Knowing what stocks are good and bad and knowing when to buy or sell doesn’t come naturally.

            "full_content": "A booming corner of the financial markets that has only been available to institutions might soon be open to everyday investors.  According to The Wall Street Journal, some of the biggest private equity and investment management giants want to offer retail investors access to exchange-traded funds backed by private credit. The term broadly refers to loans made to companies and consumers by nonbank lenders.  Historically, fund managers have sold \"alternative assets\" like private debt to institutional investors at a high cost, generating returns of around 10% in recent years — more than they would have seen from investing in the stock or bond markets. Now, as those institutions slow allocations to private credit, the biggest players in the space want to target a new class of investors.  According to the Journal, firms like State Street, Apollo Global Management, and BlackRock are working to roll out private credit ETFs to regular investors.   The challenge, though, is building a highly liquid ETF out of illiquid private loans. That hurdle is also what will likely draw the eye of regulators as they ensure the ETFs are appropriate for retail investors.  But if these ETFs get approved, they will enable regular investors to tap into a booming market, one that BlackRock expects will more than double to $3.5 trillion by 2028.  The race to launch private credit ETFs has heated up in recent months. In May, Capital Group and KKR teamed up to start offering funds investing in both public and private assets—including in private credit—starting next year. Last month, State Street proposed a private debt ETF to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The ETF would blend public debt with private debt on mortgage, corporate, and consumer loans purchased from Apollo Global Management.  Anna Paglia, State Street's chief business officer, said in a statement the ETF would \"democratize access to private asset exposures,\" and make them \"more accessible to a wider swathe of investors.\" \"It is our goal to bring these investments to scale and help facilitate the process of making private assets more accessible and liquid over time. We see this as only the beginning of a new wave of innovation as public and private markets increasingly converge,\" Paglia said.  Alternative assets make up a small share—less than 3%—of individual investors' global investments, KKR's head of Global Client Solutions Eric Mogelof, told the Wall Street Journal. But he says there is huge potential for that share to grow by over three times. \"We anticipate these allocations to rise to 10% or greater in the future,\" he told the Journal.

            "full_content": "China has announced plans to ramp up government debt issuance in a bid to boost its economy. In a press briefing in Beijing on Saturday, China's minister of finance Lan Fo'an outlined a new package of fiscal policy measures designed to help local governments tackle debt problems, spur the property market, and replenish banks' capital. \"We will increase support for local governments in resolving government debt risks, increase debt limits on a larger scale, and support local governments in resolving hidden debts,\" he said. Fo'an, who did not specify the size of the stimulus package, added that there was \"considerable room\" to issue debt and called the measures \"counter-cyclical.\" China slipped into deflation in 2023 as a result of weak domestic demand and a struggling property market. Chinese equities rallied in September on the back of a series of easing measures announced by Beijing aimed at stimulating growth. JPMorgan's Asia Investment Strategy team said that those measures indicated \"a greater sense of urgency to pull the economy out of deflation and restore confidence among consumers and private sector businesses.\" But Chinese stocks plunged ahead of Saturday's meeting as questions grew over the government's plans. The benchmark CSI 300 fell 7.1% on Wednesday — its biggest one-day fall since 2020. The lack of specific details on the size of the new stimulus package will hence leave investors wanting. \"The strength of the announced fiscal stimulus plan is weaker than expected. There's no timetable, no amount, no details of how the money will be spent,\" Huang Yan, an investment manager at Shanghai QiuYang Capital Co, told Reuters. Jump to"

            "full_content": "The biggest player in non-bank loans has set a massive new goal for itself: more than doubling its $562 billion private lending business to $1.2 trillion in five years. The trillion-dollar goal has become a high watermark for asset managers generally. Blackstone became the first private-equity firm to manage $1 trillion in assets last year, while KKR set its own trillion-dollar goal this year. But unlike its competitors, Apollo gets the lion's share of its growth comes from its lending arm, which was bolstered by growing demand for private credit in the face of a banking crisis, and by the firm's merger with retirement services provider Athene, which has provided Apollo with the ample capital it needs to make loans. \"Everywhere in the world, banks are being asked to do less, and investors are being asked to do more,\" Apollo CEO Rowan said at the bank's annual presentation for investors on Tuesday. Indeed, private lenders like Apollo are increasingly providing investment-grade lending to large corporate clients in addition to short-term loans. On Tuesday, Rowan and Apollo's deputy CIO of credit, John Zito, pointed to Apollo's AB InBev deal four years ago as a watershed moment for the firm, and a told-you-so moment for the industry. \"When we did the first investment grade financing for AB InBev a number of years ago, many in this room and many of our competitors and most of the street said, 'That $4 billion is the last $4 billion that you will ever do,'\" Rowan said. \"That was $100 billion ago and $11 billion just for Intel. This is just getting started.\" At $1.2 trillion, Apollo will manage as much in loans as JPMorgan Chase last year, according to data tracker Statista. (Rowan and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon have debated the merits of private credit before, as BI has previously reported.) Apollo plans to more than double both its private credit and equity businesses by 2029, which would bring total assets under management to roughly $1.5 trillion. At its last investor day in 2023, it set a goal to hit $1 trillion in total assets under management, including private loans, by 2026. Here's how Apollo plans to grow to over $1 trillion in private lending alone. Alternative asset managers like Apollo and Blackstone have been the stars of the last ten years in financial services. The industry's market cap has grown from $2.3 trillion to $3.4 trillion since 2014, but alternative asset manager's market caps have grown from only 4% of all financial services to 12%, and they've grown five times over in ten-years.Rowan looked back to 2008, when all of the largest alternative managers were roughly $40 billon in assets under management. By the end of 2023, when the firm was at $650 billion, it had grown between 16 or 17 times over, numbers that Rowan said are rare in financial services. \"We actually outgrew Apple, we outgrew Microsoft, \" Rowan said. \"We outgrew almost every growth company you could think of.\" Apollo forecasts up to $100 trillion in capital expenditures in three interconnected growth areas over the next 10 years: $30 trillion to $50 trillion in energy transition, $30 trillion in power and utilities, and $15 trillion to $20 trillion in digital infrastructure like data centers. But while banks and the capital markets fueled the last great era of growth amidst low interest rates and globalization, the firm thinks that this \"new era\" may look like a much older era, 1890 to 1920. \"We've seen this movie before,\" James Zelter, copresident of Apollo Asset Management said. Insurance companies, like New York Life, were the main sources of the capital necessary to finance the infrastructure of a new era, such as railroads and electrification. \"The capital needs were long-dated at that point in time,\" Zelter said. With a new turn towards a new era of infrastructure, capital needs have again become much longer than the balance sheets of the banks, or the public capital markets, can handle. Apollo's merger with Athene brought life insurance and retirement capital to its balance sheet and is a key part of Apollo's future strategy. Athene's balance sheet has $235 billion in assets under management, plus an additional $69 billion from its Apollo-Athene dedicated investment program, and an additional $392 billion in third-party capital from clients. That capital, especially Athene's capital, which needs to pay out life-insurance annuities, is looking for long-term, safe yield. While many alternative firms are working with life-insurance capital, Apollo has brought it in-house. This allows the firm to lend in a wide-variety of ways over the long-term. As banks scale back their own lending, Apollo expects to step in and finance the future. \"These long-term solutions across a variety of cost of capital are not really appropriate for bank balance sheets who fund themselves short,\" Rowan said. Apollo has its own capital to invest, but it also of course invests on behalf of other investors. And through that activity, it sees allocations to fixed-income and debt, rising, the firm's executives said on Tuesday. \"If you showed me the page from 1994 to 2022 and this is the allocation of fixed income, I would have told you it would be a horrific career decision to be in fixed income from 1994 to 2022,\" Zito said. \"We built our business as everybody was taking money out of fixed income.\" Still, the firm grew multiple fixed-income business lines, which now should give it a head start and help attract investors. \"There are many of our competitors who literally do not have a credit allocation team because they got completely out of the business,\" Zito said. \"They're just starting to build the business back up.\" The private market has made a large impact on the sub-investment grade market over the past ten years, taking up $1 trillion of the roughly $3 trillion market. But it's barely even tapped the surface of the $9 trillion investment-grade market, of which Apollo is a clear leader with its Intel and AB InBev deals. Additionally, there's a $20 trillion asset-backed finance market with only $500 billion in funds raised, a pittance. \"In asset-backed, no one's really done it,\" Zito said. \"It's very small. We think it's one of the biggest drivers of our business over the next decade.\" While Apollo's Athene transaction brought huge amounts of capital to its balance sheet, the firm was quick to silence any naysayers who said that was the firm's only large growth bucket.  \"Many people look at our growth and they'll always say, okay, it's driven by Athene, not third party.\" Zito said. \"You're seeing we grew third-party revenues in the last five years by 20%. The next five years, we anticipate third-party revenues to grow by 25%.\" While Apollo plans to explore new frontiers over the next five years, it definitely hasn't forgotten its original DNA of making returns for its third-party investors.

            "full_content": "Balaji Srinivasan, the former chief technology officer of Coinbase, is a weird guy. He’s talked about living forever. He helped finance a pro-steroids athletic competition. And he once threw away a million dollars betting a random Twitter user that Bitcoin would cost a million dollars each. By far, the weirdest thing about Srinivasan, however, is that he is the proselytizer of a new ideological movement that wants to do the same thing to cities that crypto did to money. For a very long time, Srinivasan has been calling on Silicon Valley to “secede” from the rest of the United States. The free-market tech guru doesn’t just want space from regulators and government officials; he literally wants the industry’s coders and bigwigs to split off and crowdfund their own separate country. Srinivasan is one of the main proponents behind “the network state,” an anarcho-capitalist school of thought that seeks to basically create privatized communities that break with modern historical precedent and run themselves like decentralized corporations rather than cities with governments. While it would take a much longer article to effectively explain what Srinivasan believes and what he hopes to get out of his crypto-laced hyper-libertarian project, the short story is this: big money is fueling Srinivasan’s vision and proponents are already attempting to create real-world proofs of his weird belief system in experiments like the Honduran enclave of Prospera. Some people have alleged that California Forever, the floundering tech-funded urban development project in the Bay Area, is another effort connected to the ideology. Srinivasan has recently opened a school where would-be disciples of his bold new philosophy can go to learn about the tenets of the “network state.” He even seems to have nabbed an island where this education can take place. “Through the power of Bitcoin, we now have a beautiful island near Singapore where we’re setting up the Network School,” a website connected to the project claims. It also advertises the opportunity to “learn technology,” “burn calories,” and “earn currency.” The “90-day residential program” started Monday and will continue until Dec 23, the site states. Wired reports that tuition is free, although participants will have to pay $1000/month for accommodations with roommates and $2000 for a solitary room. For that price of admission, there’s a lot of weird stuff being offered. Participants will get to “complete daily problems in mini classrooms” that “involve a combination of coding and posting on social media, and earning “proof-of-learn” NFTs upon completion,” Wired writes. It’s not really clear what that means, though when you put it all together it sounds like an expensive DeFi-themed summer camp. Even more unappealingly, Wired writes that Srinivasan has offered attendees the opportunity to do “workouts, meals, and health lessons” led by Bryan Johnson, the tech guy who has spent millions of dollars to “de-age” himself but has only really succeeded in making himself look like an unhealthy version of Tilda Swinton. If, for some reason, all of this sounds appealing to you, you can follow the technocapitalist experiment via Srinivasan’s Substack. I would advise against it but, as they say, it’s a free country. \nBalaji SrinivasanBitcoin  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \n          The fraudsters allegedly used multiple trading bots for the wash trades.\n         \n          The cryptocurrency community is not amused.\n         \n          Who invented crypto?

This high-performance storage device originally priced at $549 is available for just $299 which is a substantial 45% discount. See at Amazon Samsung has long been recognized as a leader in SSD technology and the latest T9 model exemplifies why it’s considered the best in the industry. This cutting-edge SSD is engineered to meet the diverse needs of content creators, gaming enthusiasts, academics and professionals. Its standout feature is the blazing-fast data transfer capability and boasts sequential read and write speeds that can reach an impressive 2,000MB/s. The T9’s design philosophy centers on flexibility and broad compatibility. It works seamlessly with a wide array of devices from traditional desktops and laptops to specialized equipment like professional-grade cameras and modern gaming consoles. This versatility is particularly beneficial for professionals who frequently transition between different work environments or need to transfer large datasets across various platforms effortlessly. To complement the hardware, Samsung has included its proprietary Magician Software with the T9. This suite of tools is designed to help users maximize the drive’s potential and offers features such as performance optimization, regular firmware updates, enhanced security options and ongoing health monitoring. This ensures the T9 maintains peak performance and reliability throughout its operational lifespan. The timing of this deal is particularly advantageous. While it originated during Prime Day, Amazon has extended this offer to all customers making it accessible to a broader audience during this weekend. This level of discount on a premium Samsung SSD is rare, and it’s unlikely that we’ll see a better price even during upcoming sales events like Black Friday. Keep in mind that while the deal has been extended for a few more days, it’s still subject to stock availability. Given the popularity of Samsung SSDs and the significant discount being offered, there’s a real possibility that stock could run out quickly.

            "full_content": "\nThis article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.\n      We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site.\n     Amazon continues to offer an unbeatable deal on the Samsung T9 4TB SSD and extends the exceptional Prime Day pricing to all shoppers, not just Prime members. This high-performance storage device originally priced at $549 is available for just $299 which is a substantial 45% discount. See at Amazon Samsung has long been recognized as a leader in SSD technology and the latest T9 model exemplifies why it’s considered the best in the industry. This cutting-edge SSD is engineered to meet the diverse needs of content creators, gaming enthusiasts, academics and professionals. Its standout feature is the blazing-fast data transfer capability and boasts sequential read and write speeds that can reach an impressive 2,000MB/s. The T9’s design philosophy centers on flexibility and broad compatibility. It works seamlessly with a wide array of devices from traditional desktops and laptops to specialized equipment like professional-grade cameras and modern gaming consoles. This versatility is particularly beneficial for professionals who frequently transition between different work environments or need to transfer large datasets across various platforms effortlessly. To complement the hardware, Samsung has included its proprietary Magician Software with the T9. This suite of tools is designed to help users maximize the drive’s potential and offers features such as performance optimization, regular firmware updates, enhanced security options and ongoing health monitoring. This ensures the T9 maintains peak performance and reliability throughout its operational lifespan. The timing of this deal is particularly advantageous. While it originated during Prime Day, Amazon has extended this offer to all customers making it accessible to a broader audience during this weekend. This level of discount on a premium Samsung SSD is rare, and it’s unlikely that we’ll see a better price even during upcoming sales events like Black Friday. Keep in mind that while the deal has been extended for a few more days, it’s still subject to stock availability. Given the popularity of Samsung SSDs and the significant discount being offered, there’s a real possibility that stock could run out quickly.

            "full_content": "The FBI created its own cryptocurrency company and crypto token in order to bait fraudsters who would make fake trades in order to boost the price before cashing out, according to a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice. The FBI operation, dubbed Operation Token Mirrors, was unprecedented in the crypto space and 18 individuals and entities have been charged over their alleged fraud and manipulation in indictments announced on Wednesday. Three firms, ZM Quant, CLS Global, and MyTrade, allegedly offered their services to engage in what’s called wash trading of the FBI crypto token, along with about 60 other coins, to make it appear that there was tremendous interest. A fourth firm, Gotbit, allegedly engaged in similar wash trading but didn’t trade the FBI’s dedicated token. The wash trades were made using “multiple trading bots,” according to the DOJ, which have since been deactivated, and at least $35 million in crypto has been seized. The crypto company and token created by the FBI was called NexFundAI and was built on the Ethereum blockchain. The token had a dedicated website that looked identical to any of the other sites created for cryptocurrencies that are created every day, but it now includes a banner at the top that reads, “This website was created at the direction of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as part of an investigation into cryptocurrency fraud and market manipulation. For more information, please click here.” The link for “click here” directs visitors to the DOJ press release about the indictments. The indictments include Telegram and WhatsApp chats between the alleged fraudsters, along with the memes and GIFs they were sharing about their activity. The indictment against CLS Global’s Andrey Zhorzhes also includes quotes from a video chat he had with the FBI (with the agency appearing under the guise of NexFundAI), where Zhorzhes explained how his company’s services work: “What the FBI uncovered in this case is essentially a new twist to old-school financial crime. ‘Operation Token Mirrors’ targeted nefarious token developers, promoters, and market makers in the crypto space,” Jodi Cohen, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Boston Division, said in a press release. “What we uncovered has resulted in charges against the leadership of four cryptocurrency companies, and four crypto ‘market makers’ and their employees who are accused of spearheading a sophisticated trading scheme that allegedly bilked honest investors out of millions of dollars.” “The FBI took the unprecedented step of creating its very own cryptocurrency token and company to identify, disrupt, and bring these alleged fraudsters to justice,” Cohen continued. Of the 18 individuals and entities charged by the DOJ, so far four have pleaded guilty, and another has agreed to plead guilty. Three other defendants in Texas, the UK, and Portugal have been apprehended this week, according to the agency. Those charged so far include: Will these charges deter future scammers? That remains to be seen. But in the two hours after the indictments were announced Wednesday, dozens of new tokens with the name NexFundAI were created, according to a search of DexScreener. We’re going to guess the crypto space will continue to be a Wild West of finance with more scammers than anyone can properly count. Anyone who bought or sold tokens from any of the companies being charged, including the FBI’s own token, is encouraged to contact the FBI as a potential victim of a crime. But crypto fans are pointing out on social media that it’s pretty rich for the FBI to create a scam token and then implore the people harmed by that same scam to seek help from the FBI. \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \n          One of FTX's executives begins a seven year prison sentence with a humorous update to his LinkedIn profile.\n         \n          The cryptocurrency community is not amused.\n         \n          No, LEGO isn't taking a dip into the crypto pool, but you should probably change your password on their website.\n         \n          Who invented crypto?

            "full_content": "2024 has not been kind to the watch market. After peaking in May 2022, watch prices on the secondary market have fallen for nine straight quarters, according to a report from WatchCharts and Morgan Stanley. The Big Three watchmakers — Rolex, Patek Philippe, and Audemars Piguet — have been more easily able to meet demand, in some instances due to increased production and in others due to declining sales as the luxury market struggles amid rising interest rates and economic uncertainty. Meanwhile, inventory is flooding the resale market as those who purchased watches as an investment when the market was hot rush to cash out. There are now four times as many preowned watches on the market as there were at the start of 2021. \"Once they see the prices falling and that there's less liquidity in the market, they try to sell,\" Charles Tian, the founder and CEO of WatchCharts, told Business Insider of traders. \"That floods the market with inventory and inevitably drives prices down.\" But there are bright spots. The Big Three still rack up waitlists. 63% of Rolex models are trading above retail, according to the WatchCharts and Morgan Stanley report. That number is 60% for Piguet and 41% for Patek Phillipe. Prices on the secondary market are dictated by supply and demand. \"Luxury brands like Rolex and Audemars Piguet have a strategy of maintaining limited availability at official retailers, which often means that many of their most desirable models are perpetually sold out in stores,\" Paul Altieri, the founder and CEO of online luxury watch retailer Bob's Watches, said of the Big Three manufacturers, likening them to luxury fashion players like Hermès. \"Anytime you have demand exceeding supply, where the supply is limited, or demand is hyperinflated, you get this big disparity between secondary market value and retail price,\" he added. Recognizable models like the Rolex Daytona or GMT-Master II are perpetually in high demand, Tian said, while other styles can rocket into the stratosphere because of social media trends. Other styles, like the Rolex Oyster Perpetual in Turquoise Celebration, have rare features, like a colorful dial, making them highly desirable, Björn Rüstmann, the lead data communications strategist at luxury watch marketplace Chrono24, told Business Insider. Chrono24, a Germany-based marketplace, looked at its top-performing brands and pulled the 10 models selling at the highest premiums over the manufacturer's suggested retail price. The marketplace provided the retail and resale prices in Euros, which Business Insider converted to USD. While the numbers suggest these models make the smartest investments, Altieri warns against buying a watch solely because of its resale value. \"Find something you are going to enjoy, not something that you think will go up in value,\" he said. \"Quality assets always go up in value, whether it's real estate, stocks, arts, or watches, so buy what you like.\" Model: 336934 MSRP: $17,666.68 Market price estimate: $27,760.20 Model: 126067 MSRP: $28,551.10 Market price estimate: $46,964.92 Model: 126710BLRO MSRP: $11,978.34 Market price estimate: $22,658.20 Model: 226627 MSRP: $15,752.33 Market price estimate: $30,827.53 Model: 363.179 MSRP: $30,629.54 Market price estimate: $60,607.10 Model: 126500LN MSRP: $16,955.64 Market price estimate: $33,869.70 Model: 5811/1G MSRP: $77,700.57 Market price estimate: $155,549.91 Model: 5968A MSRP: $60,208.92 Market price estimate: $137,056.23 Model: 15416CE.OO.1225CE.01 MSRP: $109,281.81 Market price estimate: $274,452.68 Model: 124300 MSRP: $7,110.43 Market price estimate: $18,814.19 This story was updated to clarify the retail prices of the watches.

            "full_content": "China's investors are looking forward to some stock market action after the country's weeklong National Day break. Beijing released a stimulus blitz on September 24, sending the markets on a hot run. Mainland China's benchmark CSI 300 Index closed 17% higher year-to-date on September 31 before the weeklong break — a stark contrast to its meltdown and lackluster performance for much of the year. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed 1.6% higher on Monday. It's up about 35% year-to-date. On Monday, a day ahead of the mainland's markets reopening, China's version of Twitter, Weibo, was abuzz with discussions about what the markets may hold. China's domestic stock markets are dominated by retail traders, who number over 200 million and account for about 70% of trading volume. Trending topics on Weibo included #Hong Kong stocks, #How long this bull market can run, and #How A-shares will perform after the holiday. A-shares are stocks of Chinese companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. \"I hope the rally can hold for a bit longer, so that I can at least get my initial investment back,\" wrote one Weibo user. The CSI 300 index was down 45% from a 2021 peak until the pivotal announcement in late September. There was also a trending hashtag discussing those who fear they will not be able to buy A-shares on Tuesday. Before the weeklong break, some brokers and traders reported delays on the Shanghai Stock Exchange as systems were so overwhelmed by enthusiastic investors and market watchers. Despite the market rally, skeptics about China's economic outlook and markets abound. \"I don't feel reassured now that the topic is trending,\" said a Weibo user in a thread discussing the likely duration of the bull market. The thread garnered nearly 700 likes in half an hour. Given the extent to which China's stocks have sold down before Beijing's stimulus announcement, there may be more upside to come. Goldman Sachs, for one, has upgraded China's stocks to overweight and is forecasting another 15% to 20% upside to Chinese shares. Beijing's \"coordinated forceful policy announcements\" amid \"an oversold, undervalued, and under-positioned market backdrop\" are key factors in their reasoning, the bank's analysts wrote in a note published on Saturday. There could also be earnings growth potential for companies should the economy respond positively to Beijing's coordinated stimulus, they wrote. \"Together, these announcements constitute a more substantial quantum of policy stimulus that contrasts with the sporadic and modest easing measures over the past few years,\" they wrote, even as they warned that China's macroeconomic challenges remain serious. China's stimulus measures include interest rate cuts and 800 billion yuan, or about $114 billion, to support the domestic stock markets. The country's top leadership has also pledged more stimulus is on the way. The world's second-largest economy is facing multiple challenges including a property crisis, deflation, and high youth unemployment. Jump to"

            "full_content": "What does it take to be a rising star on Wall Street?If our list is anything to go by, you have to be an intensely hardworking, intellectually curious team player who's willing to go the distance to drive the biggest deals, win the most sought-after clients, or build the most successful businesses.  Every year, Business Insider taps its contacts to put together a list of who to watch on Wall Street. For the past seven years, we've received recommendations from bosses, colleagues, recruiters, and financial industry experts to create our annual feature. We ask that nominees be based in the US, be 35 or younger, and stand out among their peers to be eligible. The editors make the final decisions. These young professionals reflect the future of finance. A number of them are shaping the future of clean energy and artificial intelligence by financing the infrastructure that will underpin it. Some have seen their focus go from niche to hot asset. Others are influencing how Wall Street interacts with Main Street, using their skills and savvy to create new products and services for ordinary investors or giving employees at portfolio companies ownership stakes.  Business Insider asked these rising stars from leading firms like JPMorgan, Bridgewater, and Apollo to reflect on their successes, challenges, and best career advice. One of the most memorable days of Song's KKR career was when the firm sold Minnesota Rubber and Plastics for $950 million in August 2022. She had served on the business' board while getting her MBA and led the monthslong sales process. The best part, however, was traveling to the firm's Plymouth, Minnesota, manufacturing plant to tell employees they'd be receiving a payout as equity holders in the company. Since trialing its employee-ownership program in 2015, KKR has awarded billions of dollars of equity to over 100,000 nonsenior management employees across more than 50 portfolio companies. The firm bet that giving portfolio company workers a piece of the private-equity pie would actually grow the size of the pie.   Since graduating from Harvard in 2015, Song has worked on KKR's industrials portfolio team, which has been a proving ground for the employee-ownership program. She worked for four years on the firm's CHI Overhead Doors deal, which has become the case study for its employee-engagement model. All five deals she's worked on at KKR have an employee-ownership component. Song, who grew up in Silicon Valley after her family emigrated from China when she was 3, has long been a community builder. She rose through the ranks of Future Business Leaders of America in middle and high school to become the California state president before serving as copresident of Harvard's Undergraduate Women in Business program.  Song, now a principal at the firm, said the feeling of community on the industrials team is one of the reasons she's stayed at KKR for nearly a decade. She said her friends and family were surprised she ended up investing in industrials, but she's become fascinated by the sector. \"Everything that you can learn about in a business textbook, this role takes it to the real world, and I can see it in action here,\" Song said. While researching investment-banking internships in college at Emory, Cheslin contacted a family friend who invited her to visit his trading floor and experience Wall Street for herself. It was love at first sight. \"I walked onto the trading floor and never looked back,\" Cheslin told BI. \"As soon as I walked onto the floor, heard the energy, heard the noise, I was like, 'This is somewhere that I want to be.' Maybe that sounds cliché.\" Today, Cheslin is a managing director in high-grade municipal trading at Wells Fargo. She joined the bank in 2012 as an analyst based in the firm's Charlotte, North Carolina, office, but later transferred to New York. She became a managing director in February.  Cheslin, who's part of a team that manages billions, works with institutional clients to address their liquidity needs. She recalled an inflection point in her career in early 2022 when she was on maternity leave and the market was hit by volatility stemming from the Fed's interest-rate hikes. She recalled returning to work in what she characterized as a \"completely different market landscape.\" But the team pulled through and logged a record year.  \"Knowing that I was a visible part of the effort to grow Wells Fargo's market share and to be growing our municipal franchise to be one of the top sales and trading desks on the Street is something that I'm incredibly proud of,\" she added. She said one key quality that's helped fuel her rise is staying open to whatever work opportunity has come her way. \"Being visible not only on your desk as someone who is willing to do any task — I think that's the mindset that I've tried to keep from analyst to managing director is that I'm never bigger than any task that I would do myself.\" Anton got an early start in finance, buying stocks in high school during the 2008 financial crisis. Some bets, like buying Bank of America stock at its trough, paid off. (He chalks up less-successful bets, such as one on Bear Stearns, to experience.) This introduction came in handy for his first job after college as a financial institutions group analyst at Credit Suisse's investment bank. He spent two years there and another two at Kohlberg and Company before joining Apollo in 2018. The 32-year-old principal's work runs the gamut from insurance to agriculture. He helped raise capital for Apollo's retirement services unit, Athene, by developing a fundraising strategy that allows third parties to invest alongside the firm. These funding vehicles, or \"sidecars,\" have raised $9.3 billion in committed capital as of June 30.  Anton was also Apollo's day-to-day lead on Vallourec, the French steel giant. Apollo sold its 28% stake for 955 million euros, about $1.04 billion, in March. Anton helped lead the acquisition of Vallourec during the COVID-19 pandemic and the firm's restructuring, which included moving operations from Germany to Brazil. He anticipates more opportunistic metals deals on the horizon as prices decline.  Anton, who majored in history at Princeton, credits his versatility to his fondness for learning about different sectors and the successes and failures in each field. \"A lot of stuff has been done before,\" he said. \"If you have the curiosity and build up your knowledge of the past, I've found that to be really beneficial as you think about covering new sectors or moving to a new job.\" As Apollo courts wealthy individuals, Anton is developing new investment products that allow the firm to partially cash out quarterly or monthly in exchange for somewhat lower returns. Apollo sells about $1 billion a month in semiliquid products spanning private credit and real assets. \"It's going to be a really big growth area for the firm,\" he said. Carper has spent his career carving out a specialty in a niche area of finance: continuation vehicles, also known as \"secondaries.\"  He helps private-equity firms raise new funds to purchase companies they already own — giving existing investors a return while keeping the company's current management team and extending the life cycle of the asset for the PE firm.  \"Effectively, what we do is we help private-equity firms sell their highest-conviction, favorite portfolio companies to themselves,\" Carper said.  He spent the first five years of his career as an investor on the buy side, including stints at Morgan Stanley and Coller Capital, before joining Lazard's private capital advisory business in 2018 and Jefferies in 2021. Earlier this year, Carper helped Vestar Capital Partners close a $1.2 billion continuation vehicle for its stake in the research company Circana. He also helped Calera Capital close a $750 million continuation vehicle for the linen and laundry service company ImageFIRST.  Over Carper's career, these structures have switched from being a solution to a liquidity problem to a strategy that allows PE firms to hold on to some of their best portfolio companies and raise new capital, he said. When he entered the industry, he estimated there was less than $10 billion in continuation-vehicle volume annually. Now, there's more than $60 billion, and he thinks that will only grow. \"I'm really excited to say that I think as a portion of the overall ecosystem, it's quite likely to grow,\" he said. \"There's a lot of capital that is being formed to attack the opportunity right now.\" Cecil, one of two deputy chief investment officers at $108 billion Bridgewater Associates, was so ready to work full time at the firm that he dropped out of Columbia University to jump-start his career.  \"The thing I really liked was the intensity, the competitive nature of markets, the authenticity of Bridgewater's culture,\" Cecil, who first interned at the firm before joining full time in 2017, said.  In his current role, he works closely with co-CIO Greg Jensen to gather insights and research from different teams and turn them into trades for the flagship strategy, Pure Alpha, which was up more than 14% through the first half of the year.  \"The oversight is about innovation — what's the big thing we might be missing?\" Cecil said.  Reams of deep research don't go far if there's not \"a trader's mentality\" to actually extract \"a piece of alpha\" from them, he said. He said he's constantly thinking about how to make sure the portfolio is \"the expression of the things we believe about the world.\"  He was promoted to his current role at the start of this year after making his name at the firm with his research on currencies. That background has pushed him to search beyond stock and bond markets for alpha — and to consider how different assets will work in a single portfolio. \"There's a lot more room for us to think about how all these asset classes come together,\" he said. Being named a portfolio manager of BlackRock's Total Return Fund in 2022, alongside the managers Rick Rieder and David Rogal, was a defining moment for Chen. \"Becoming a named PM — it is incredible,\" Chen told BI. \"I see that as a result of the ongoing contribution that I have had toward this set of funds and to the group.\" Chen calls herself a BlackRock lifer. She's been at the company 13 years and started out as an intern in the same fixed-income investment division she's currently in — only now she's comanaging a total of $60 billion across BlackRock's core, core plus, and global government portfolio mandates and leading research efforts for US rates. The Total Return Fund has about $20 billion in assets. Chen grew up in China and moved to the US by herself at 17 to attend high school in Ohio. She studied economics and statistics at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts and joined BlackRock full time in 2012 as an analyst focusing on US interest rates. She also had a stint as a macro researcher on the economics team. BlackRock's managing director credits her rise to the quality of her research. He said she was always willing to dig deep into the data to uncover differentiated views, which the group's leaders noticed.  \"The intention or the motivation for me really was wanting to turn my ideas into action and see how they play out in the market,\" Chen said.  Her parents, who spent their entire careers in China's postal service, began working in their teens and studied part time to earn college degrees. They instilled a strong work ethic and passion for learning. \"They basically immersed in me to just spend time at the library,\" she said. \"I think my mindset of always trying to explore and trying to see more of the world came from a very young age because of that.\" White started his career working in franchising for Burger King, where his job was to bring on larger, better-capitalized franchisees, which usually turned out to be a PE firm or a family office.  \"The stories from the families and the entrepreneurs and the funds and their thesis were super interesting to me,\" he said. \"So I decided to go to school and scale that up.\" After completing his MBA at Northwestern in 2017, White joined Bank of America's consumer and retail investment banking team in New York. He's since played a key role in introducing a new focus for Bank of America as part of its emerging growth and regional coverage team. \"A lot of our strategy was to take all the resources and all the talent that we were putting against bulge-bracket opportunities and bring it to the middle market and try and find opportunities that normally Bank America would not have been as tuned in to,\" White said. He took \"a leap of faith\" and joined the team in Chicago in 2019. \"It was kind of full circle, having started my career with entrepreneurs,\" said White, who now advises family-owned businesses, founders, and early investors in those companies to deepen the bank's relationships in private capital markets and attach that to its public capital markets business. Even in a time of muted IPOs, White led a large industrial IPO this year. In 2023, he was key in advising a large financial sponsor client in a take-private transaction in healthcare. He also helped lead a buy-side transaction for a family-owned consumer business, where Bank of America was both the advisor and financing partner to the client. He has advised on more than 30 transactions totaling over $25 billion. Since White joined the Chicago team, he has helped it grow from three to 25 people. His advice to young professionals in the industry is to \"be your own feedback loop.\"  \"Don't wait for someone to tell you something did or didn't go well. Assess every situation yourself, almost obsessively think about, 'How can I have done that better?'\" Kolwicz's parents worked in education in Warwick, New York, and though Kolwicz became an investment banker and not a teacher, he has adopted some of their characteristics. \"My dad, for better or worse, anytime I asked him a question, it turned into a lesson with him,\" Kolwicz, a managing director in mergers and acquisitions at the elite boutique investment bank Moelis, told BI. \"Sometimes, I find myself doing that a little bit too much with the people below me,\" he added with a laugh. \"I want them to feel as invested in it from a junior level as I do from a senior level.\" He landed an internship at UBS in 2010 on the media and communications team. That led to a full-time job at the Swiss bank. He joined Moelis nine years ago and was elevated to the role of managing director in December. Kolwicz has advised on nearly 50 deals across various industries, collectively valued at about $125 billion. The deals span verticals from healthcare to media to energy. One of the largest deals he's advised on was last year's roughly $21 billion all-stock merger of WWE with Endeavor, the owner of Ultimate Fighting Championship. He's also been key to building Moelis' mergers business in the emerging cannabis sector. He's made a name for himself working on transactions like the $2.1 billion sale of Harvest Health & Recreation to Trulieve Cannabis Corp in 2021. The Harvest Health sale was a watershed opportunity for Kolwicz to plant his flag. He worked on the deal as an executive director before his promotion, collaborating closely with a colleague on executing the deal and presenting to the client's board every week. \"The amount of experience for me to be able to do something like that\" as an executive director, he said, \"you don't really get it that often.\" Cardona approaches her often high-pressure job as a lead banker at RBC with a perspective not many on Wall Street possess. \"I was illegal for 15 years of my life. I had to go through a lot of issues just getting through school,\" said Cardona of her move to New Jersey from Manizales, Colombia, when she was just 6 years old. \"These are really big, real-world problems that I had to face on my own. So working, I would say I'm probably the most levelheaded of anyone on the team, because nothing really is that serious.\" Cardona worked multiple jobs to pay her way through her financial engineering degree at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey. She landed a spot in RBC's 2016 summer investment-banking internship and joined the firm once she graduated. Over the past six years, she's risen from analyst to vice president. As a member of RBC's communications, media, and entertainment banking team, Cardona worked on Apollo Global Management's $5 billion acquisition of Cox Media Group in 2019, the first and largest LBO in the TV broadcasting industry. She also helped close the radio broadcasting company MediaCo's acquisition of Estrella Media earlier this year. The COVID pandemic and subsequent interest-rate hikes stalled a lot of deal flow in her coverage area, but Cardona said she has high hopes for what's in store in the next year or so. She's seeing a lot of clients and media company owners waiting for the election and interest-rate cuts to play out.  She aims to be a mentor to young Latinos who aspire to go into banking. This year, she's leading a new program where she and other RBC employees will mentor 30 high schoolers from three New York City public schools. Cardona's message to other Wall Street hopefuls is to be unapologetically persistent, she said. \"If I had let any doubt fill my mind in these 10 years, I would not be here. I was set up to not be here, actually.\" Going into energy investing was a natural choice for Stone Redding, who hails from a suburb between Dallas and Fort Worth. \"Growing up in Texas, you're definitely exposed to energy as an important part of the economy and the state,\" she said. \"And the cost of energy and the form of energy are such a core part of driving the broader global economy. That was always really fascinating to me.\" Stone Redding started her career at Morgan Stanley's investment bank in 2013 after graduating from the University of Texas at Austin's business school. She joined TPG in 2015, working on buyouts in traditional energy such as oil and gas. She left after 2 ½ years for a promotion at Warburg Pincus but returned in 2021 to work on clean-energy deals when TPG raised its Rise Climate fund, which closed in 2022 with $7.3 billion. Over the past three years, she has been involved in five deals that total about $1.5 billion in equity, per TPG. The principal helps lead North American deals in energy transition and sustainable fuels. She executed TPG's investment in the solar-tech company Nextracker, its spinoff, and its initial public offering. Nextracker now has a market cap of $5.7 billion. Stone Redding is interested in \"the picks and shovels,\" aka the equipment-and-services providers that benefit from renewable-energy adoption but carry less risk than energy producers. In May, TPG Rise Climate acquired Olympus Terminals, a Southern California firm that stores and distributes renewable diesel fuel, for an undisclosed amount. Clean energy spans a wide range of business models from manufacturing to software. Stone Redding said setting priorities and sticking to them is the hardest part of her job. \"There's a lot of exciting things to do in our space, and we have a small but mighty team,\" she said. Wilson is a top credit underwriter at Blue Owl Capital, overseeing nearly $5 billion in deals across some 20 transactions in her five years there.  Wilson was primed early on for a life in leveraged finance thanks to some formative bonding moments with her mother over, well, bonds. She has fond memories of visiting her mom — now retired after 25 years working in municipal bonds — on the Deutsche Bank trading floor in Boston and playing around with the Bloomberg Terminal. This inspired a fascination with how companies operate and also a belief that women could succeed in the male-dominated finance industry.  Years later, after graduating from Boston College in 2015, Wilson joined a mid-market credit firm as the only woman on a six-person investment team analyst class.  \"I didn't have any real reservations or qualms about joining an analyst class where I was the only woman,\" Wilson said.  She moved to Blue Owl, then known as Owl Rock, as an associate in 2019 and quickly garnered trust and was given more responsibilities by senior leaders. She credits her success, in part, to her knack for fastidious preparation — anticipating the critical information a busy exec may need and having concise answers at the ready.  Wilson, who was promoted to vice president in January, has helped underwrite and execute loans to firms including Inspira Financial and Worldwide Clinical Trials, and in 2020, she also took a lead role in Blue Owl's small-business lending program during the COVID-19 pandemic, which provided working capital to 11 borrowers. She has watched private credit's explosion into a $2 trillion market firsthand. Blue Owl's credit AUM has grown from roughly $15 billion when she joined to over $95 billion today. Even as deal sizes have ballooned — what were once $1 billion transactions are now commonly $3 billion to $5 billion or more — her approach hasn't. \"Fundamentally, the job hasn't changed, but the scale and scope of opportunities has grown,\" Wilson said. Khosla was climbing mango trees at 12 years old in his native India long before he climbed the ranks of Wall Street to become a managing director at Goldman Sachs. \"I am very much a proponent of luck and gratitude,\" Khosla said. \"I mean this when I say it: Never in my wildest dreams did I assume I would be here, when you asked the 12-year-old boy.\" Today, Khosla leads the investment-grade financing and corporate derivatives business for healthcare and real estate within Goldman's global banking and markets unit. He works with clients on their financing needs and advises them on deal-specific risks —  like changes to interest rates — with the goal of positioning Goldman as a \"top-tier\" financier to strategic clients and asset managers.  Khosla said that being part of the team that rolled out Goldman's transaction-banking business, which handles cash for big corporate customers, helped distinguish him. But when asked what attribute has most contributed to his success, he pointed to the emotional — not just the technical. \"Some of my most successful transactions have been where I've really doubled down on that EQ and compassion,\" he said, \"which is to truly get to know your clients, not just as corporations, but actually as the people that they are.\" It's likely a big factor in his promotion to managing director in 2019. Khosla moved to the US full time in 2006 to study at Georgetown, where he landed a gig as a bank teller at the student-run Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union. Khosla became the credit union's chief financial officer and treasurer in 2008 — before he was even of legal drinking age. \"I was the CFO of a $15 million balance sheet in the heart of the financial crisis,\" he said. He went on to join Goldman as an analyst in 2010. Away from work, Khosla, a married father of two, is passionate about improving education in the juvenile-justice system and sits on the board of the nonprofit BreakFree Education. When Dan joined Citadel Securities in 2022, he was given an ambitious mandate to establish the firm's presence in Japan.  Dan, who was born in China and grew up in Japan, was mostly starting from scratch. Citadel Securities had neither Japanese clients nor an office in Japan, and Dan, one of the first hires on his team, worked mostly as a one-man show advising clients on their fixed-income trades. But as one of the largest foreign holders of US Treasurys with more than $1 trillion in holdings, Japan represented an untapped gold rush for Ken Griffin's market maker.  Citadel Securities now has trading relationships with at least 30 top fixed-income firms in Japan, Dan said, covering nearly all the major investment firms in the country. As a senior vice president of fixed-income sales, Dan offers his perspective on the economy and market moves to Japanese banks, asset managers, pensions, and life insurance companies. From his home base in New York, he acts as a sounding board for clients' investment ideas to ultimately win more trades for Citadel Securities.  Before Citadel Securities, Dan spent the prior 10 years fostering relationships with Japanese financial institutions for Deutsche Bank, where he worked on the fixed-income sales team. Becoming a part of clients' everyday routines has also helped Dan grow market share.  Dan usually starts and ends his day the same way: on the phone with his clients. He gives them market updates every day over the phone; for some key clients, that's been the case for the last five years, he said.  \"Consistency is key. I think no matter what you do,\" Dan said, \"do it every day so that clients remember you, and then it becomes their custom to read your comments.\" DiGia is a professional investor who has supported roughly $1 billion worth of investments during his time at General Atlantic. In some ways, he's also a professional taste tester. As a vice president who leads food-and-beverage investing and focuses on restaurant franchising and apparel, his love of food has become an important part of his job.  \"I love trying new brands and new restaurants, and the thought of working with brands that I'm a consumer of every day was really appealing,\" DiGia, who joined General Atlantic after spending two years as an investment banker on JPMorgan's consumer and retail team, said. \"But I didn't realize how exciting the job could be on the investing side.\" At General Atlantic, an investment in the Austin chain Torchy's Tacos turned every fast-casual lunch into a case study, with DiGia often asking staff about the business' operations. He left General Atlantic for a short stint in 2020 to get an MBA at Stanford, though he didn't get far. He interned with his old portfolio company, European Wax Center, assisting in the chain's 2022 IPO. He now sits on the boards of Joe and the Juice, Restore Hyper Wellness, and Athletic Brewing. While DiGia's tastes might influence his investments, becoming a shareholder of Athletic Brewing actually altered them. Athletic Brewing is the top-selling beer, alcoholic or otherwise, at Whole Foods Market, DiGia said. Athletic's success and the rapid growth of the nonalcoholic beverage category, compared with a flatter trajectory for traditional beer, prompted General Atlantic to lead a $50 million equity financing.  When DiGia began working on the deal, he didn't have much of an interest in nonalcoholic beer. But now, he fits them into his social life, replacing his usual drink during a work dinner.  Elliott was Bank of America's top vice president globally in interest-rate sales last year, generating nearly $30 million from large hedge-fund clients — production more in line with directors and managing directors.  There's no obvious connection between Elliott's background and his ascendance in Bank of America's global markets division. How does food services and catering experience translate into elite hedge-fund sales?  Elliott grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, the son of two small-business entrepreneurs. His father ran a cleaning business and his mother a catering company, which meant a tenacious approach to work \"was just kind of drilled into me — the idea of outworking everyone else in order to shine, in order to get visibility,\" he said. That ethic helped him earn his first internship in high school when the CEO of a food-procurement corporation saw Elliott's hustle at one of his mother's catering jobs and offered him an opportunity typically reserved for college students.  Wall Street didn't emerge as a career path until the summer before his sophomore year at Duke when he attended a Bank of America diversity summit. \"It was terrifying because I knew nothing about finance, but it was amazing to see senior people who looked like me could succeed on Wall Street,\" Elliott said. He didn't let lack of expertise discourage him from a great opportunity, studying to get up to speed after the bank offered him a summer internship. \"I didn't have the most technical finance background, but I did consider myself, in most rooms I'd go into, the hardest worker.\"  But success serving hedge funds requires savvy, not just intensity. Elliott said he treats every client meeting or dinner as if it's the most important moment of the day, and he comes armed with strategies and ideas that cut against the grain. \"You don't want to be a salesperson that always agrees with the client,\" Elliott said. \"You want to have different perspectives for them to analyze.\" Elliott also helps further the company diversity efforts that once helped him, including serving as recruiting cochair for Bank of America's group committed to developing and engaging African American leaders. Rooney, a sub-portfolio manager at the multistrategy hedge fund Eisler Capital, literally took an off-the-beaten-path route to his current role. While Rooney and Eisler declined to comment on this story, the 27-year-old investor told his former Citadel colleague Michael Watson about his circuitous journey to investing last year on the latter's podcast. Growing up in Ohio, Rooney said he didn't finish high school, choosing instead to bounce around jobs, including leading wilderness trips.  While leading a canoeing trip in Canada, he met a college administrator who told him to get in touch if he wanted to return to school. He ended up at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he studied math and statistics and interned for the agriculture trading shop Louis Dreyfus. He said a senior trader told him hedge funds would try to woo him but that he should ignore their pitches for a steadier career at a place like Dreyfus — unless it was Citadel on the other line.  \"I didn't even know who Citadel was at the time,\" Rooney, who promptly went to the firm's careers website and applied to be a commodities trader, said.  Nowadays, he knows that \"no 23-year-old is a portfolio manager at any hedge fund, much less Citadel.\" But he was hired as an associate after a long Zoom call with an agricultural trading executive at the firm and told to dive into livestock trading.  He taught himself how to code in Python and added biofuels to his remit during his more than two years working for Ken Griffin before joining Eisler in October 2022.  He now trades derivatives across different asset classes at Eisler's New York office but still has his wilderness experience in the back of his mind. \"If there's a thunderstorm and you're in the middle of a 20-mile-wide lake, you got to get to shore,\" he told Watson.  Rooney said it gives \"you a real appreciation of the fact that random stuff can happen, and there's real risk imbued in that randomness.\" No workday for Williams has been the same for nearly a decade. Williams was the first hire by the activist lawyer David Rosewater for Morgan Stanley's new shareholder activism and corporate defense team in 2015. Since then, Williams has worked for General Motors as the automaker beat back proposals from David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital to create two classes of stock and Bristol Myers Squibb, which came under attack from the activist Starboard Value over its $74 billion acquisition of Celgene in 2019.  \"I always have loved the strategic aspect of it,\" she said. \"There is no typical theme; there is no typical evolution. Each client is different.\"  Defense is in her blood — her father's a retired vice admiral in the Navy, and her brother is a US Naval Academy graduate. While she considered the same path for herself, she didn't see herself becoming an officer for the long term.  Instead, she gets to do \"my own version of defense, in finance.\" \"My parents tell everyone I'm still in the family defense business,\" she said. Her focus is on keeping Morgan Stanley's well-regarded team among the industry's leaders while also \"constantly evolving.\" While the big-name activism campaigns and contentious proxy fights get the most headlines, she relishes working with companies on their strategies preemptively.  \"Every situation is incredibly unique,\" Williams, who has worked on hundreds of different defense strategies over the years, said. \"You help them think through and plan how they can control their own destiny,\" she added. Zhu joined Blackstone in 2015 as the company was raising $4.5 billion for its second energy fund. Since then, Zhu has helped mentor a team that has grown to more than 30. And in the past year, he's worked on more than $2 billion in energy-transition investments. Zhu invests in assets that support renewable-energy adoption. He's worked on acquisitions of companies that will be central to upgrading the electric grid, including Blackstone's 2021 deal for Sabre Industries, which manufactures steel utility poles and towers, and its 2023 acquisition of Power Grid Components, which makes safety devices for substations. Zhu grew up with his grandparents in China, but at 17, he decided to challenge himself by applying to college in the US. He didn't speak English at the time but was accepted to the University of Guam, one of the few places that would take him without an SAT score. From there, a postgraduate business course helped him get into Duke's Fuqua School of Business. He then spent two years working in energy investment banking at BMO Capital Markets, where he realized he was more interested in working on the tangible versus the theoretical. He said he's so drawn to why things happen and the factors that make up people's lives and communities that he sometimes wonders if he should've majored in sociology or psychology. It's a big reason he enjoys working in energy transition: The real assets he helps buy can make a difference to people around the world. While he was negotiating a deal for the backup power company Trystar earlier this year, Texas experienced a catastrophic seven-day power outage. Zhu quickly saw how the company's growth could make an impact. \"The benefit would be incredibly tangible and would impact a lot of lives,\" he said. Eid-Holm considers himself a \"social nerd.\" The 32-year-old is a principal at Ares Infrastructure Opportunities, a $12 billion arm of the Los Angeles-based alternative asset manager Ares Management, where he focuses on digital assets, including data centers.  \"I'm a math person, but I also like to talk to people,\" Eid-Holm said.  That flexibility comes in handy in a business that sits at a complicated intersection between real estate and the utility and technology industries. \"Often the hardest part of getting a project off the ground is not an engineering problem; it's getting the right permits, working with the community,\" Eid-Holm said. Data-center development is booming, driven in large part by the proliferating need for the computing power and storage necessary to develop and commercialize artificial intelligence. Eid-Holm has helped Ares push into the asset class, including an undisclosed investment by the company in Prime Data Centers, a prominent data center developer and operator.  As power has been exhausted on the grid, Eid-Holm has had to get creative. \"Traditionally, the utility would build all the transmission lines and a substation next to the data center,\" Eid-Holm said. \"We're increasingly seeing an opportunity/requirement for the developer to take on more and more of that role.\"  Eid-Holm said he began to notice investment opportunities in the data-center space in the mid-2010s when he was a young executive at Deutsche Bank.  \"One deal the first year became two deals the next year became my full-time job,\" he said. \"For me, it's been: Work very hard, and lean into good opportunities.\" Eid-Holm was raised in Ottawa and came to New York to work in finance after graduating from the University of Waterloo. He has a fiancé and said he often reads books \"directly or tangentially related to my job\" in his free time.  \"I'm very passionate about what I do,\" he said. \"I work too hard for it to be only about financial results.\" Gilbert's first foray into finance was a flop.  \"I vividly remember going into my first interview with Barclays, and I totally bombed the interview,\" he said. \"I have joked that the interviewer pulled out his phone five minutes into the interview and was replying to work emails.\"  But growing up as a competitive athlete, playing everything from basketball and soccer to being a double black belt in karate, Gilbert was conditioned to try to rebound from the losses. \"It was, kind of, the kick in the ass that I needed in order to put my career into hyperdrive,\" Gilbert said.  Gearing up allowed Gilbert to rise from UBS's investment bank to Summit Partners, a growth equity firm in Menlo Park, California. He's now the managing director of capital markets at Thoma Bravo, one of the world's largest technology-focused buyout firms, with some $142 billion in assets under management.  Gilbert's team of six works with banks, other PE firms, and direct lenders to secure financing that enables Thoma Bravo's dealmakers to make investments. The credit can come from new investments but also from refinancing and repricing existing investments.  Through his relationships with about 150 banks and direct lenders, Gilbert has led the industry with pioneering financing structures — such as utilizing private debt markets — to arrange more than $84 billion in total funded debt since 2018. One loan helped finance Thoma Bravo's $10.7 billion acquisition of the planning software provider Anaplan. Gilbert and the team bypassed traditional banks to secure a $2.9 billion loan from PE lenders, including Blackstone and Apollo Global Management, within eight days.  This year alone, Gilbert and the capital markets team have led 25 refinancings and repricings totaling over $23 billion in transaction volumes. Those efforts have saved Thoma Bravo more than $250 million in annual interest savings across the firm's portfolio. Spending her first years at BlackRock as an analyst in its corporate mergers-and-acquisitions advisory arm gave Ding, now an infrastructure investor, a front-row seat to the firm's push into private markets. The Princeton grad joined BlackRock in 2015 after a stint at the investment firm Harding Loevner. In the years she spent on the corporate strategy team, BlackRock acquired First Reserve Corporation's energy-infrastructure investment platform and the private credit firm Tennenbaum Capital Partners. More recently, BlackRock made its biggest push into private markets, agreeing to buy Global Infrastructure Partners for $12.5 billion.  The chance to learn where the world's largest asset manager was placing its bets was a \"very compelling place to be,\" she said, and it ultimately convinced her to join the infrastructure business in 2019.  As the head of Americas for BlackRock's infrastructure solutions unit, Ding advises on about $15 billion in capital commitments and oversees the origination, underwriting, and management of infrastructure investment opportunities in the US, Canada, and Latin America. She has directly led or co-led over $2 billion of investments, ranging from renewable energy to data-center businesses to waste-management companies. She sees a \"tremendous amount of opportunity\" in companies related to energy transition, security, and reliability. She also focuses on the infrastructure players set to benefit from the decarbonization of carbon-emitting industries such as transportation and waste. Her path to private markets was influenced by her mentor, the late Jerry Kenney, an advisor to BlackRock and a former Merrill Lynch executive who led the bank's expansion into investment banking. As an analyst, Ding took on side projects for Kenney, who was working on ways to grow BlackRock's alternative-investments business.  Ding says she continues to raise her hand to take on extra work her team needs to succeed. \"It doesn't matter if you're a director or a VP and you consider it analyst-level work,\" she said. \"If it needs to get done to move the business or a team forward, you just do it.\" In two years, Alcalay has built a high-performing business in a buzzy macro strategy for the quant behemoth Two Sigma.  Few hedge-fund trades have inspired more hype lately than Alcalay's niche, the lucrative basis trade, which harvests small price discrepancies from highly levered government-bond positions. \"It's really hard to hire good people for that seat because, for the most part, the good people are doing really well, and their firms are clinging on to them tightly,\" Colin Teichholtz, a senior portfolio manager who was looking to build out a team at BlueMountain in 2018, said. He was thrilled to happen upon a young, relatively unknown trader at Barclays. Alcalay comes from an unorthodox background. He's a former information warfare officer with the US Navy, where he earned the prestigious Joint Service Commendation Medal for his work in Afghanistan. He subsequently worked with the National Security Administration, briefing senior military leaders on strategic-level threats.  After leaving active duty, he joined Goldman Sachs in interest-rates trading, an uncommon career path for military veterans. But Alcalay's war-zone experience sharpened skills — such as making sense of raw data and sources of intel and judging their limitations to draw a conclusion — have proved well-suited to bond trading, a trader close to him said. He has the \"capability to layer human intuition on top of technology,\" the trader said. At BlueMountain, Alcalay identified trades not just in US Treasurys but also in the European and UK markets. Alcalay covered it all and did so with poise, Teichholtz said. When panic struck the repo funding markets in 2019, he kept his cool. \"He generated returns in excess of our targets with a really high Sharpe,\" Teichholtz said. Alcalay joined Brevan Howard two years later. In 2022, Two Sigma sought out Alcalay to build a bond basis trade strategy. His trading book has since grown substantially, and the firm continues to scale up around his strategy, people familiar with the matter said. Alcalay founded a group to support other veterans involved in trading, and he helped organize a recent networking event and panel at Two Sigma for translating a military background to quantitative finance.  Portfolio manager Gnedin grew up in a family full of astrophysicists and rocket scientists — which is part of the reason she never wanted to be one.  \"I guess for me, acting out was choosing the econ path,\" Gnedin said. The Princeton alum was inspired by her economist grandfather, the \"lone black sheep\" of the family who \"was always the most interesting man at any dinner party,\" she said.  But after two years as an analyst in investment banking, Gnedin, \"a little bit jaded on finance,\" went in search of something new. In 2017, she landed a position at the largest publicly traded hedge fund, Man Group, where Gnedin has forged a path that marries her family's backgrounds.  Gnedin originally joined as a quantitative researcher building algorithms for the firm's systematic investment arm, which relies on mathematical models to make investment decisions. One algorithm that Gnedin developed systematically reviewed existing model performance and identified which models should be retired. Since launching in 2019, the algorithm, one of the first of its kind at the firm, has led to about two to three models a year being dropped, she said. In 2020, Gnedin moved to the portfolio management side of the business, where she directly manages about $1.4 billion in equities in developed markets. As a quant PM, Gnedin said her job is more about managing models than specific stocks. She still spends plenty of time researching modeling techniques in old textbooks and tinkering with algorithms.  When she's not nose-deep in economic research or alternative datasets, you can likely find the San Franciscan taking in the views on the Stonewall-Panoramic Trail in the East Bay with her husky. When she entered the University of Georgia, Osteen planned to pursue a career in science, but she fell in love with economics after taking an introductory course at the end of her sophomore year. After graduating in 2016, she interned at the Federal Reserve full time while studying applied economics at George Washington University. She earned her master's degree and spent another four years at the Federal Reserve as a research assistant and financial analyst.  Osteen became more interested in working on Wall Street as she learned the ins and outs of stress testing and analyzed pending mergers-and-acquisition proposals from large banks. Seeking a faster-paced environment, Osteen left in 2022 to join Fidelity's asset management division as a fixed-income portfolio analyst.  \"Taking on challenges and trying to figure out puzzles really gets me motivated and passionate, and I feel like that is what asset management and fixed-income markets are all about,\" she said. \"You're constantly trying to figure out and use all your resources and information to piece the puzzle together.\" She works with a team of three portfolio managers with about $72 billion in assets, including a low-duration bond ETF that has amassed $374 million since its February launch. In addition to her day-to-day account management work, she oversees due diligence and relationship management with bank and insurer partners for the desk's $35 billion book of stable value funds, a popular low-risk product that is guaranteed by insurers. Osteen, who had no experience in asset management before joining Fidelity, credits her swift transition to her willingness to speak up. \"Not being afraid of ask questions and give your opinions and thoughts constructively is very important,\" she said. \"It's just really being comfortable and willing to put yourself out there.\" At JPMorgan Asset Management, Lenihan manages $21 billion in 8,000 customizable portfolios that provide generous tax advantages for the firm's clients. He is an architect of the bank's booming Tax Smart Separately Managed Account platform, which leverages the technology of 55ip, a fintech that Lenihan helped identify for a partnership and JPMorgan then acquired. The dual role of fund manager and product developer combines his interest in finance with his engineering background.  An engineer by training, Lenihan began his career monitoring the quality of suppliers' parts at Chrysler. Soon, however, he found himself thinking more about the economics of how truck and car parts played into the company's profitability than the manufacturing aspect.  Hung up on these questions, and after talking to friends from the University of Michigan about their finance internships, Lenihan decided he wanted to know more about investing. He was hired into a rotational analyst program for JPMorgan's private bank, and to get closer to an investing role, he took on additional projects with portfolio managers and earned his CFA.  Learning about how companies make money, why they should be financed, or their value, was \"really intriguing to me,\" Lenihan, who also has an MBA from Wharton, said. \"And as I got there, it was something that I just kind of fell in love with — really dove in since day one.\" His programming skills and willingness to pitch in on different projects led to opportunities like building out the firm's robo-advisor with his mentor, Ted Dimig. Lenihan led the development of a product that required buy-in from across internal tech teams, third-party partners, and operations. \"That was the genesis of a lot of my passion and love for that dual-hat role was being able to flex multiple skill sets,\" he said. He still dedicates time to finding fintech partners to work with or acquire. Lenihan also launched a mentoring program that seeks to build connectivity among different teams at the asset manager.  \"I have learned firsthand about how successful you can be with those close partnerships when you work together, \" he said.

            "full_content": "Wall Street, American Psycho, The Wolf of Wall Street… for decades, the image of the banker has loomed large in popular culture. And after the 2008 financial crisis, the reputation of finance workers took a big hit, according to one of the creators of banking drama Industry. Konrad Kay, who co-writes the series, says bankers faced a \"lazy\" and \"villainous stereotype\" at the time - with a perception that they needed \"bringing down a peg or two\". Industry is a critically-acclaimed drama set inside the fictional London office of Pierpoint & Co, a prestigious, high-pressure, sex-and-drug-fuelled international investment bank. It is now airing its third series. Critics have called the series - that introduces new character Sir Henry Muck, a hyper-privileged eco-entrepreneur played by Game of Thrones star Kit Harington - an \"excitingly ornate rollercoaster\" and \"more thrilling than ever\". For Kay and co-creator Mickey Down, who both previously worked in finance, their show is not a simple question of whether bankers are good or bad. \"I guess what the show is saying, and we're never didactic about this stuff, is that Pierpoint and the wider capitalist enterprise turbocharge some of their worst instincts,\" says Kay. Ultimately, bankers are \"neither villains nor rock stars\", he adds. Industry looks at some of the nuances of the financial world, the writers say, and especially the people at the beginning of their careers. According to Down, the show is driven by the characters who have the least amount of power. Industry follows three Gen-Z finance workers: Harper Stern (played by Myha'la), Robert Spearing (Harry Lawtey) and Yasmin Kara-Hanani (Marisa Abela). Down adds that Industry is about realising there are \"different ceilings for everyone\" - and that your background, race and gender can \"have a huge bearing on how successful you can be\". This is partly why the co-writers say they portray the character of Harper, arguably the most ruthless of the three main characters, \"with love\". \"People obviously throw a lot of words at these characters, insults sometimes, especially at Harper, saying she's awful, she's heinous, she's selfish, all that stuff,\" says Down, adding: \"We write her from a place of understanding. \"We write her as a young black woman who has come from a disadvantaged background, who is ridiculously ambitious and will do everything to achieve her goals - and that is thrilling.\" Copyright 2024 BBC.

            "full_content": "One year after starting her investment banking job, Angie Chen received her bonus. She then put in her two weeks notice. \"I used to feel so cool saying I worked in finance, in investment banking, I'm not going to lie,\" she told Business Insider. But Chen said that the status of a career in finance wasn't worth the grueling work. The highly coveted six-figure starting salary — and potentially millions if you successfully work your way up the banking ladder — is usually accompanied by long hours. The typical 80 to 100-hour workweeks have caused some junior bankers to complain about burnout and exhaustion. Although she was aware of what a job on Wall Street entailed, Chen said that it became less tolerable for her after graduating from college. \"I think as I grew older, I just valued my free time, my independence, and just personal interest and passion a bit more than just grinding 24/7 for a corporate company,\" she said. Chen, who made content about her investment banking career on TikTok, said that her social media inspired her to consider entering the marketing industry. \"I loved the creative freedom that I had from it,\" she said. \"As I was thinking about transitioning out of banking, marketing was one of the roles that came up.\" Now a campaign marketer, Chen said that she has gotten several comments claiming she \"downgraded\" in her career, but they don't bother her — especially since she believes that many assume that marketing is a low-paying industry. But the field offers several positions that are more \"analytical and data-driven\" with higher pay, she told BI. While the pay for various marketing roles varies, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the average salary for marketing managers in the US to be $166,410. For those considering a career pivot of their own, Chen offered the following pointers. You might not be happy at your current job or company, but Chen said it takes time to understand why. She suggested making a list of reasons you don't like your current role but also the positive aspects of your company. Chen said it helps you visualize what you want in your next firm and narrow down your priorities when looking at different opportunities. \"For some people, it might be culture and team, but for others, it might be money and prestige,\" she said. \"For me, the biggest one was exit opportunity, and the second was pay.\" Eventually, Chen narrowed her ideal positions to campaign management, growth marketing, and product management marketing — which she hopes to eventually work her way into. \"I thought it was a perfect blend of my interest in marketing, my analytical background, and my coverage of technology,\" she said. \"It combines everything into one singular role.\" Chen also said she found the culture within marketing less overwhelming than that of banking, where she said she struggled to find a senior mentor. \"My current manager is very hands-on with my day-to-day,\" she said. \"So there's a lot of chances to gain visibility and just showcase where you add value.\" Other experts have also advised breaking down whether you are being \"pushed\" out of your current profession because of something you don't like or if you're being \"pulled\" toward another opportunity. If something is pushing you out of your role, consider implementing certain changes, like switching teams, that can rectify your role. While cold messaging on LinkedIn is a common strategy, Chen suggested trying to obtain \"warmer contacts,\" or contacts suggested by mutual connections. \"Definitely quality contacts over quantity,\" she said. \"When I network, I don't like it to be super formal.\" Chen said that because she was fairly transparent to her banking coworkers about her interest in marketing, several of them offered their contacts in that industry. \"I was also just fortunate because I was sharing my career journey on social media,\" she said. \"A lot of people had actually reached out to me to give advice and recommend roles or people to talk to.\" She also said that people should do their \"own basic homework\" and narrow down a few roles that they are potentially interested in before reaching out. Chen said during her research, she broke down the different sub-verticals within marketing and eliminated areas that she was not interested in. \"And then ask people why they chose this industry, what their long-term goals are, any advice they have,\" she said. \"And if any of those resonate with you, that might be the field for you.\" Don't assume your résumé is ready just because it worked for you in your current industry. Chen said that when she presented her résumé to marketing professionals, several had \"no idea what it was even talking about.\" \"My résumé was very, very finance-heavy,\" she said. \"I did have to revamp it completely to just make it less finance jargon and more marketing-friendly.\" Chen spoke with many marketing experts to \"understand the way they speak\" and familiarize herself with industry terms. Based on their feedback, she simplified her CV by removing any deals and finance-specific nuances and highlighting \"transferable skills\" that were applicable to both industries. \"Data and analytics were big ones since that's the direction that marketing is heading, and client relationship as well,\" she said. \"Also presentation and project management skills.\" Career coaches have also advised job seekers to keep their résumé specific but also include specific keywords tailored to their new industry.

            "full_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. Learn more. I’ve always had a love-hate relationship with curling my hair, and it’s been a long journey finding the best curling irons to style with. My tumultuous tryst with curling irons probably began because not only is my very naturally flat, straight hair hard to curl to begin with, but also because I’ve had my fair share of curling iron burns on various areas of my face and neck throughout my teen years (don’t ask). I hated the trial and error of learning how to curl my hair in those days, but loved how my curled hair transformed me every time, whether it was bouncy ringlets for my adolescent theater performances, rounded curls for my senior prom, or loose waves for college graduation. Never have I gone to an important milestone in my life without a curling iron—no matter how clumsy my hands were or how bulky the device was. But curling irons have come a long way since the late 2010s, and have followed me into adulthood as I test out various hair styling tools for my job as a beauty editor. Ceramic barrels, multistyling blow-dry curlers, and ion technology have ushered in easier ways to control temperature and allow for more dexterity, and are much quicker to use than their medieval counterparts of the early aughts. Here, I tested some of the best curling irons on the market to uncover which stylers rose to the top for someone like me with very hard-to-curl hair, plus which ones are best for wherever you may be in your curling iron journey, whether you have long hair, are a beginner, or just want a beachy wave. These were my favorites—and in case you were wondering, I’m happy to report that I did not burn myself with any of these!

What’s Better, Ceramic or Titanium Curling Irons? Curling irons are typically either tourmaline ceramic or titanium, and while neither is necessarily better than the other, there are a few differences to keep in mind when shopping. Ceramic irons generally take longer to heat up, and they can also distribute heat more evenly, making them suitable for thinner and finer hair types. Titanium curling irons, on the other hand, heat up very quickly and are better if your hair is thicker or coarser. You’ll want to choose either a ceramic or titanium curling iron depending on your hair type and texture. Since I have longer and thinner strands, I found that the ceramic irons I tested were a bit more suitable for me. What’s the Difference Between a Curling Iron and a Curling Wand? A curling iron typically has a safety clamp that allows you to hold the hair in place without needing both hands. Curling wands don’t have a clamp—so you’ll have to hold the tip of your hair as you curl it. Both irons and wands have their pros and cons: The safety clamp can sometimes leave a funny crimp in your hair (which I experienced while testing a handful of these), while wands unfortunately make it a lot easier to burn your fingers (which thankfully, I was able to avoid). How We Tested I tested these curling irons over a span of a few months, right before a handful of events and occasions when I wanted to add more volume and style to my look. My hair is thin and pin straight, but there’s a lot of it, so I was most excited about the irons that not only successfully curled my hard-to-curl hair, but that allowed me to do so in a short amount of time. I typically sectioned my hair in pieces from left to right. Although I did test upper and lower sectioning a few times, I found the former to be more successful for me personally because it was more comfortable for my arms and allowed me to focus on each strand of hair a bit better. And for those science buffs out there: I tested all of these on second-day hair, except for two (the Dyson Airwrap and Shark FlexStyle) that require damp hair. I usually curl about three-quarters of my hair (from midshaft to end), so I tested roughly that length for every iron I tried. I also used a heat protectant spray and set most of these (except one … more on that, later) with hairspray. This multistyler was by far the quickest and easiest to use out of all the curling irons I tested—even for someone like me, who hasn’t always been so confident using hot tools in my day. While there is a bit of a learning curve with this one (I learned the hard way that your hair really should be damp instead of wet), I somehow was able to curl (and fully dry) my hair within 25 minutes—an impressive feat for the length of my hair. I loved that this iron had a simple rotating switch at the top of the barrel to allow you to change airflow depending on what side of your hair you’re curling, and I also really liked how smooth my hair felt after curling: there were no flyaways in sight. The only thing missing from this curling iron/styler was a temperature gauge. Instead, it has a few buttons that allow you to customize the drying fan, plus a cool shot button to use at the end of styling. Although I couldn’t see the exact temp, did love the fact that it only heats up to 302 degrees Fahrenheit though, which helps minimize heat damage and is about 100 degrees less than the other curling irons I tried. I also loved that it has multiple barrel sizes, including a thicker 1.6-inch barrel and a 1.2-inch barrel to allow you to customize your curl. I opted for the thinner one, which I found gave me a little more room to wrap all of my hair. The curls were long-lasting and stayed smooth and frizz-free throughout my day. It’s certainly pricey at $600, but can easily become an integral part of your everyday haircare routine (whether you’re looking for a great blow dryer, flat-iron equivalent, or curler appropriate for normal-to-damaged hair), which makes it well worth the investment. By far the second-to-best curling iron I tested was this lightweight pick with an extra-long barrel. It certainly lives up to its name: I didn’t have to apply more than one pass to achieve silky-smooth curls. I also loved the clamp on this one because it wasn’t too heavy or bulky, and didn’t leave me with a dreaded clamp crimp. It felt comfortable in my hands and the longer barrel made it easy to wrap my long hair around it. The only thing I didn’t love about this iron was the temperature gauge, which sits at the base of the iron and has a row of circles that light up from bottom to top depending on how hot the iron gets. I didn’t love that I was unable to really gauge how hot the iron was getting, but I will say that it is very easy to control the heat distribution—whenever I moved it a notch or two down or up (by twisting the very bottom of the iron left or right), it pretty much immediately felt cooler or warmer—there was no wait time in between. This one gave me looser, voluminous curls that looked great after brushing them out, and I can definitely see myself reaching for it again for special occasions or when I’m looking to add a little volume and personality to my usually-very-flat hair. This long-barrel styler has excellent reviews; is suitable for all hair types, including naturally curly hair; and promises to give you silky, frizz-free curls thanks to its tourmaline ceramic-plated barrel. I tested this long barrel curling iron during a wedding weekend I attended earlier in the fall, and believe me when I say I was thoroughly impressed. Here’s the rub: I completely forgot hairspray during this weekend trip (oops), so I relied on this iron and dry shampoo to somehow carry me through a nearly eight-hour wedding day. I loved how quickly it heated up, and the elongated barrel made it simple to thoroughly wrap each section around it. I didn’t find myself having to participate in any upper limb gymnastics—instead, I held it up with one hand and used the other to wrap entire strands and sections around the barrel: I had plenty of room. Something else I loved about this curling iron was how strong the clamp was. I didn’t lose any pieces when curling; instead, everything stayed in place which made the whole process a lot faster. It didn’t take much to get a nice curl, and the curls themselves were smooth and flyaway-free. After setting them with an entire travel-sized dry shampoo later, the curls lasted throughout the entire wedding event, only decoiling and flattening by the very end of the night. This one also has dual-voltage, making it a great pick for international travel. Pretty impressive for no hairspray, I’d say! If you’re balling on a budget, this hair tool gets the job done but might take a few times to get the hang of. It’s rather bulky compared to the other hot tools I tested, and I felt that it gave my very hard-to-curl hair more of a wave than a curl. I’d recommend giving this one two passes if you have a similar hair type to me, and although I found the outcome to be less than impressive, it was decent if you’re looking for a little volume and wave. I did like that the heat was consistent and easy to control with this one by turning the knob at the base of the iron. I also like that it has a little lip on the underside of the iron to make sure it doesn’t slip or slide around when you put it down. I’d recommend this one if you’re not looking to invest a ton in a curling iron, or have short hair that curls easily and quickly. This high-quality curling iron gave me long-lasting, bouncy curls and heated up in a snap. The barrel itself is elongated and features a lightweight metal clamp that takes the guesswork out of holding your curl in place as the iron heats it. One of the things that stood out to me was the fact that there’s no temperature dial. I’m guessing that this choice was made to presumably make it easier to use, but I found it a little confusing. As someone who prefers to keep an eye on the temperature of my heat tools, I didn’t love the vague color-coated temperature settings that appear on the main button: It turns blue when the device is in between 300 and 320 degrees Fahrenheit, white when it’s 340 to 360 degrees, and red when it’s 380 to more than 440 degrees. Instead, I would’ve at least preferred a small screen that displays the temp in real time—I’d just like a little more insight to determine if my hair is about to burn off from high heat. Either way, I was impressed by the longevity of the curls this one gave me, and I’d recommend it if you’re looking for a durable curling iron that gives you a long-lasting finish. I love a good multitasking beauty product, so I was super excited to try this styler. Although it’s not a traditional curling iron, it comes with two different interchangeable barrels (one for the right side of your hair, one for the left), a blow dry head, and multiple brush heads to blow dry, straighten, or curl damp hair after washing and using conditioners. After giving this a whirl, I can definitely report that it blew dry my hair well, but the curls didn’t last super long. There’s definitely a learning curve with this one as well, and I think it had to do with my longer hair. I had to part my hair into really small sections to get the full section to stick to the iron. The left and right barrels also felt overly complicated, especially because they recommend clipping up the top half and curling the bottom section first and the top section second in the user guide. The issue with this is you have to switch out the barrel multiple times (one for the lower left, then again for the lower right, then again for the upper left, then again for the upper right). To make the process a little quicker, I’d recommend just sectioning out pieces and working from the left side of your head to the right side, so you only have to swap the barrel once. My long hair gets stringy and separates easily when it’s damp, so the mechanism didn’t work as well as I suspect it might if you have shorter, thicker hair that clings together more easily. Otherwise, it was one of the best hair dryers I’ve ever used and is suitable for straight and wavy hair textures, so I’ll definitely be using it again! When I tested this rotating curling iron, the first thing I wrote down was an exclamatory “cool rotating barrel!” After having used it, I still stand by that first impression. This iron does have a cool rotating barrel that makes it easy to twist your hair onto the barrel as you use it, eliminating the tedious wrapping of the hair that can take excess time. The small clamp at the bottom makes it easy to tuck an end piece of hair as the rest twists up, and I think this made it perfect for my longer hair, but it can work well on any hair length. This one is quite versatile as well, and you can achieve a few different types of curls from looser beach waves to tighter, more springy ringlets. Plus, it’s probably the prettiest iron of the bunch in a light pink and purple ombré. I will say that I definitely got more of a wave from this one than a curl, but I didn’t really mind it—the rotating iron cuts hair styling time in half, which to me is more valuable than the perfect curl. I found this hair tool the easiest to grip and handle out of the bunch, thanks to its nonslip matte material and included heat glove. It warmed rather quickly, and I found myself holding my hair onto the barrel for only around 45 seconds before it reached a nice, thick curl. I also found it to be very ergonomic generally— the iron is not too long or too short and was easy to navigate at different angles around my head when I was curling each section of hair. The only thing I didn’t love about this iron was that the base of the clamp left my hair with more of a crimp than a curl toward the top of my head. I had to go over these areas two to three more times to smooth out the crimps, which added more time to my routine. This iron is 10/10 for handling and ease of use but could use a more lightweight clamp so it doesn’t impress on the hair so intensely. If you have thick hair, this may just be the iron for you. This no-frills curling iron was my favorite out of all the curling irons I tested. The wand itself is extremely lightweight, and I had to wrap my hair around the barrel for only about 30 seconds to achieve a nice, bouncy curl. My controversial opinion on this one is that I absolutely love that it has no clamp—it was really easy for me to wind my longer, finer strands around the barrel without having to fuss or worry about it getting stuck or crimped in a clamp. Because the ceramic wand is so light, holding the ends of my hair at the tip of the iron didn’t make my arms ache or tire. Curling was quick with this one as well; I was able to do my full head in only 15 minutes, which is record-breaking for the amount of hair I have. While this one has multiple temperature settings, I liked that it didn’t get overly hot or smoking after using it with heat protectant, so I was able to avoid the dreaded singeing smell you get when you use hot tools on finer hair types. Speaking of hot tools, I first came across this curling iron for beginners when I was, in fact, a beauty beginner in my late high school days. Upon testing it again, I can’t say that it was my favorite out of the bunch, but it gets the job done if you’re looking for nice, long waves. The barrel I chose to test was the extra big one at 1.5 inches, so the curls I got reflected that: They were big, swooping, and similar to what I’d get if I went to a salon for a hair blowout. The other thing I noticed about this iron was that it seemed to take longer to heat up than the other curlers I tested, which is probably due to the fact that the barrel is thicker and bigger, so it’s something to keep in mind if you’re in a pinch and need to curl your hair quickly. You can’t really beat the price and accessibility of this one, so it’s definitely a great beginner tool if you’re just starting to learn how to curl your hair but aren’t ready to invest in a more advanced curler. If you aren’t ready to fully commit to curling your hair on the reg, but want to give it a little body, hear me out: This is one of the best curling tools to help you get there. There’s no twisting or turning involved for this one—in fact, all you have to do is section out your hair and clamp down to get bold, beachy waves or loose curls. While it’s technically more of a crimper than a curler, it gave me a bouncy texture and body that was just as long-lasting as some of the other curlers I tried. I liked this one a lot because it was super simple to use and didn’t leave me with any clamp crimps. It also comes with a neat little kickstand and has automatic shutoff, which came in handy as I had to run out to an event after using this one.

            "full_content": "P&O Ferries owner, DP World, will now attend the UK's investment summit on Monday, despite a row over a minister's criticism of the firm. It had been feared they might pull out from the summit - where they were expected to announce a £1bn investment - after Transport Secretary Louise Haigh criticised the ferry firm and urged consumers to boycott the company. An expansion of the firm's London Gateway port, in Essex, is likely to go ahead, with an announcement expected by some in the coming days. Whitehall sources said on Saturday that there had been \"warm engagement\" between senior figures in the firm and the government since Sir Keir Starmer distanced himself from his minister's remarks. The government is hosting the International Investment Summit, where it hopes to attract billions of pounds of investment. A Downing Street spokesperson said the summit would \"show Britain is open for business\" as it looks to enable economic growth. Later, a government source said the prime minister had confidence in Haigh.  A government spokesperson said: \"DP World’s investment in Britain is a vote of confidence in the stability and seriousness of the government. We welcome the jobs and opportunities it will create.\" They added that the government was unlocking the UK's \"potential and ambition\" by working in partnership with businesses and investors around the world.  DP World has said the expansion of the London Gateway port would bring Thurrock hundreds of jobs. The United Arab Emirates-based company also owns the container port in Southampton. It has yet to comment publicly on the latest developments. Speaking to the BBC's Newscast on Friday, Sir Keir said Haigh's comments were \"not the view of the government\". The prime minister is understood not to have been directly involved in talks with DP World, nor has he personally spoken to Haigh about her remarks. The row started after Haigh described P&O as a \"rogue operator\" in an interview with ITV on Wednesday, after it sacked nearly 800 seafarers in 2022 and replaced them with cheaper workers. Asked whether she used the ferry service, she said: \"I've been boycotting P&O Ferries for two-and-a-half years and I would encourage consumers to do the same.\" DP World insisted the move was needed for the survival of the ferry operator and to secure thousands of jobs. Haigh's comments in the interview coincided with the Department for Transport announcing new legislation aimed at protecting seafarers' jobs from so-called \"fire and rehire\" practices of \"rogue employers\". In that announcement, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner was quoted calling P&O Ferries' prior actions \"outrageous\". But senior government figures have since told the BBC that they were incensed by the specific suggestion that consumers boycott the ferry firm. Haigh's comments also attracted criticism from the Conservatives, with shadow business secretary Kevin Hollinrake arguing Labour \"don't understand business\". However, the Labour chair of the House of Commons Business and Trade Committee, Liam Byrne, defended Haigh. She had been \"absolutely right to say that the behaviour of P&O, owned by DP World, in the past has been completely unacceptable\", he said. The row has exposed a tension between the new government's desire to attract business and strengthen workers' rights.  A £1bn investment will take place, despite a row with the owner of P&O Ferries, says the business secretary. The PM tells the BBC the transport minister's criticism of a ferry company is not the government's view, ahead of an investment summit. Complex rules leave many customers feeling caught out and annoyed they aren't made clearer by rail companies. Reports have suggested the plan was at risk after Transport Secretary Louise Haigh's comments. The new legislation would strengthen rules against collective dismissal and protect wages.

            "full_content": "Stocks fell on Thursday from records reached in the previous session, as traders took in a sticky inflation reading for September.  All three benchmark indexes fell, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down TK points, a 0.40% fall, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell 0.% and 0.%, respectively. The declines follow rises across the board on Wednesday, which saw a fresh record close for both the S&P 500 and the Dow, and comes after inflation proved stickier than expected last month.  September consumer price index data released on Thursday showed inflation rose 2.4% year-over-year, slightly above consensus forecasts of a 2.3% rise. The core CPI reading, which excludes more volatile food and energy costs, was up 3.3% year-over-year and just above forecasts of 3.2%. The reading, coupled with last week's blockbuster jobs report, has sparked talk of a \"no landing\" scenario for the US economy, a scenario in which strong economic growth fuels inflation and makes it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut rates.  A no landing would likely mean rate cuts are fewer or slower than markets had previously forecast. It would also mean borrowers are saddled with higher interest rates on their debt for longer. After the CPI release, investors adjusted their expectations for the Federal Reserve's easing cycle. The September jobs report had killed the odds of another big 50 basis point cut, but the slightly higher-than-expected CPI likely isn't enough to fully pump the brakes on Fed easing. \"Heading into the report, we thought only a very firm print would lead the Fed to consider pausing in November based on inflation alone. We did not get that,\" analysts from Bank of America said Thursday. \"While core PCE will be firmer than recent months, we think it will be enough for the Fed to follow through with a 25bp cut in November,\" they added. Investors are now pricing in higher odds of a 25 basis point rate cut at the central bank's meeting next month, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims edged up 33,000 to 258,000, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. That number marks its highest level in over a year and outpaced forecasts of 230,000.

            "full_content": "US stocks rebounded on Tuesday after Monday's losses, with momentum revived by a tech rally and falling crude prices. The Magnificent 7 tech cohort led the market higher, with Nvidia at the forefront. The AI chipmaker climbed 4% on Tuesday, while Meta, Tesla, and Microsoft all traded more than 1% higher. The surge in oil prices that pressured stocks on Monday, meanwhile, retraced, with international and US crude prices falling more than 4%. Energy traders pulled back on Monday as they continued to await retaliation from Israel over Iran's missile barrage last week, while a disappointing stimulus update in China weighed on the outlook for oil demand.  In the US, Wall Street is keeping an eye on the upcoming consumer price index report for September. The inflation data will publish on Thursday, and will inform investors what to expect from the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting in November.  Though the market had been anticipating another half-point interest rate cut next month, last Friday's big jobs report erased those forecasts. Bank of America expects any upside surprise in the inflation data may keep rates higher for longer. At the same time, Fed officials have cited optimistic expectations for rate cuts to continue. On Monday, New York Fed president John Williams told the Financial Times that a quarter-point cut is a \"very good base case.\" Economists project consumer inflation for September to come in at 2.3% year-over-year, down from 2.5% in August. Tuesday's session also marked the start of earnings season. In a new report, BofA noted that the bar for third-quarter earnings is low, adding that investors will likely reward firms as long as they express confidence about lower rates. Major US financial firms, including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock, report results on Friday. Among Tuesday's notable movers was Roblox, which briefly fell nearly 10% in intraday trading, after short-seller Hindenburg Research took aim at the gaming platform. Meanwhile, China's sharp equity rally showed signs of slowing down. Beijing's failure to announce new stimulus plans on Tuesday has disappointed investors.

All three benchmark indexes surged to end the day higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 400 points to a record close, while the S&P 500 also notched a fresh all-time closing high.  Investors pushed past concerns about Google parent Alphabet to take the Nasdaq Composite 0.6% higher. The Department of Justice on Wednesday said it's considering breaking up the tech titan to remedy its status as a monopoly in the search engine space.  Bond yields rose, with the 10-year Treasury yield up three basis points to 4.071%. Here's where US indexes stood at the 4:00 p.m. closing bell on Wednesday: Investors have an eye on Thursday's consumer price index report, an inflation reading that will serve as a key input when the Fed meets to discuss its next rates move. The stakes of the next inflation reading have risen after the big September jobs number, and Wall Street could be in for some volatility in the event of an upside surprise, Bank of America said this week.  Economists are expecting consumer prices to have risen 0.1% for the month and 2.3% year-per-year in September, slightly cooler than the increases recorded in August. \"The Federal Reserve appears to remain comfortable with where inflation is and trending,\" Josh Hirt, a senior US economist at Vanguard, said in a note. \"Although inflation remains elevated, we do not see a material effect on the Fed's trajectory of rate cuts.\" Markets also gained some confidence over the path of rate cuts after the Fed released the minutes of its September FOMC meeting. Central bankers predicted inflation would fall to 2% by 2026, while risks to economic strength were \"tilted to the downside.\" Some officials, though, said they would have preferred a 25 basis-point cut at the Fed's last meeting, while \"a few others indicated they could have supported such a decision,\" the minutes said. \"[W]e think that FOMC is still spending too much time looking in the rear-view mirror, taking too much comfort from the recent strength of the economy, and not paying enough attention to leading indicators pointing to weakness ahead, and the likely lagged impact of earlier tightening,\" Oliver Allen, a senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note.  \"We expect the Fed to be acting for far more urgency to avert a significant slowdown around the turn of this year, as the economic data continue to head in that direction.\" Markets are largely expecting the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points at their next two meetings, bringing the Federal funds rate range to 4.25%- 4.5% by the end of the year.

            "full_content": "The Welsh economy is losing out because of a lack of rail investment, a transport expert has said. Prof Mark Barry said Wales should be getting a lot more money, but because spending was controlled from Whitehall, England was more of a priority. The first minister said she was doing everything she could to get more cash for the country's railways. The Welsh Conservatives said Wales should be getting its fair share of HS2 funding. The Labour UK government said investment was key to its priorities, but rail investment was run from the Department for Transport in London rather than the Welsh government. Prof Barry, from Cardiff University, said that meant Wales was down the queue for cash. He said: \"We get about 1 to 2% of the funding available but should get a lot more. \"In an ideal world you’d be looking at 5 or 6% of the total UK investment in rail enhancement, but if you don't invest in essential economic infrastructure - specifically in energy, transport and housing - then you can't really expect your economy to turn a corner.\" He said the amount of cash Wales was asking for was tiny compared with what had already been committed to English railways. \"The TransPennine Express Group Upgrade is a £10bn capital programme over 15 years,\" he said. \"In Wales we've worked up over the last five years £2-3bn in very good business cases for rail investment, and the challenge is how is that going to get funded?\" In recent years the biggest argument has been about extra funding for Wales from the HS2 project. In opposition, Labour said the HS2 rail link should be an England only scheme and Wales should get money as a result. First Minister Eluned Morgan said she had spoken to the UK chancellor about a dividend for Wales. Opposition parties want to see Wales press for the cash, an estimated £4-5bn, which they have said would pay for much improvement. The leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies MS, said: \"We need to make sure that happens so that we can spend it on infrastructure and improvement in our transport operations here in Wales, and that needs to happen, and we were told that it was a turning of the page if Labour came into government on 4 July. \"Well if that page is turned, let's have that money, and let Eluned Morgan live up to what she's professing to do, which is to stand up for Wales.\" But the UK government's Welsh secretary Jo Stevens seemed to close the door on that idea when she was asked about it in Parliament earlier this month. Plaid Cymru's parliamentary leader, Liz Saville-Roberts, told the Commons: \"The truth is that the railways are broken and Labour's plan fails to address the chronic underfunding that is the cause, particularly in Wales. \"In 2022, the secretary of state - then the shadow secretary of state - said that it was 'utterly illogical' to designate HS2 as an England and Wales project, and called on the Conservatives to 'cough up' the billions owed to Wales.  \"Will she cough up now?\" In response, Ms Stevens said: \"We cannot go back in time and change the way a project was commissioned, managed and classified by the previous Conservative government. \"They need to accept responsibility for the chaos, delay and waste on their watch. \"What we can do though is work closely with our Senedd and local authority colleagues to develop and invest in transport projects that improve services for passengers right across Wales.\" In a statement, Ms Stevens' department the Wales Office reaffirmed what she had said in the Commons and added: \"Following years of neglect, this new UK government recognises the importance of investing in rail infrastructure in Wales. \"The Welsh secretary has already met with the transport secretary to discuss investment in Welsh rail.\" It added that Ms Stevens was working closely with the Welsh government to identify a range of improvements. \"Alongside this the transport secretary is currently carrying out a review of the previous government's transport commitments which will ensure our transport infrastructure portfolio drives economic growth and delivers value for money for taxpayers.\" In just over a month, the Chancellor Rachel Reeves will deliver a Budget which is expected to set the course for what the government plans to do on investment. MPs from across the political spectrum paid tribute to Alex Salmond at Westminster, where he served for 25 years. Chancellor Rachel Reeves will set out the government's financial plans for the next year. Cuts to services loom as Welsh councils face a £500m budget gap. With Euston making headlines, we've gone back to 1969 to look at the recently rebuilt station. Here is how the chancellor could choose to tweak the government's borrowing rules to free up more cash.

            "full_content": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Annie Cole, the 35-year-old founder of Money Essentials for Women in Vancouver, Washington. It has been edited for length and clarity. In 2012, I got my first job out of college as a social worker, earning $26,000. After two years of emotionally hard work, I pivoted into education. I started working in a university's student academic resource center, helping first-year and at-risk students navigate the college experience. Two years later, I was promoted into an academic advising role. Next, I worked as a research coordinator until I finished my EdD program and got a research analyst job with a global ed-tech nonprofit. I loved and excelled at my work, and I received two executive promotions and several raises. Still, this year felt like the perfect time to step away from my VP role and make two big moves: spend more time with my family and launch my own business. It was scary, but I knew I was ready. I moved into a part-time consulting role for my old company and went all-in on building out my financial coaching business, Money Essentials for Women. I've set myself up to retire at age 45 in 10 years, but transitioning from a $26,000 salary to an early retirement plan came in phases. When I was about to finish my EdD program, I started searching for jobs, and something clicked. I was only making $32,000. I opened up Indeed and set my filters for jobs that paid $40,000, which seemed like a reasonable salary increase. Then I had this thought pop into my mind: What if you just went for something bigger? What about $60,000? I only applied for higher-paying jobs, and within a few months, I got a research analyst job with a $60,000 salary. I got nearly a $30,000 salary jump just because I changed my mind about my worth. Getting promoted isn't just handed to you — it's truly earned. Sometimes, I just wanted a clear job description, to show up to do that job, then go home and not think about work. I received my promotions because I didn't just show up and want to be told what to do. I showed up daily and asked myself, How can I help this company reach its biggest strategic goals quicker and more efficiently? How can I directly contribute to those goals every day? It takes grit, forward-thinking, and hard work to help a new company grow, and I was up for the challenge. The more value I provided to the company, the more I was rewarded with promotions and raises. I always invested in my retirement account, even when making $26,000. Once I started making more money, I became aggressive with my investment goals. I started reading personal finance books and following financial influencers online, and I slowly learned everything from how the stock market worked to different retirement and investment accounts. I invested in my traditional retirement account, a Roth IRA, and a brokerage account. I kept my budget as minimal as possible to focus on front-loading my investment accounts while I was young. My husband and I also added our first real-estate investment in 2023, which simultaneously gives us rental income and home market value growth. Trading my time for money is great, but it will always be limited. I'm setting up additional income sources to make money when I'm not actively working on them. I just launched a two-week online program for my financial coaching business that women can go through asynchronously. I also recently wrote an ebook I sell for $24.99 that captures all of my best tips in one place. This year, I'll make about $60,000 from real estate rental income, $130,000 from consulting and coaching work, and about $30,000 in investment account growth. I'll focus heavily on investing over the next 10 years (about $45,000 annually) and expect a 10% annual growth rate. When I turn 45, I'll have over $1.6 million. Using the 4% rule would give me just under $65,000 to live on annually when I retire, which is higher than my budget now. The above is based on my investment portfolio, which doesn't consider my real-estate investment property, the equity in my primary residence, and continued income from my business's online courses and books that will still pay me after I'm 45. The traditional definition of retirement is when you quit working for good and live off your investments and savings. Most recently, though, the FIRE movement (Financial Independence, Retire Early) has expanded this definition. Now, you might \"retire\" from your full-time job in your 50s but keep a 10-hour-per-week job at Starbucks to supplement your income (this is called Barista FIRE, where you work part-time into retirement). I aim for a traditional retirement when I reach 45. I'm open to the possibility that I might want to keep running my own business by then. For me, it's all about having options. I do these three things consistently to make sure I stay on track: Setting aside even the tiniest amount of money can seem like a waste of time when the alternative is to spend it now on a new shirt, better groceries, or toys for your kids. If you start making more money, it's just as hard. Lifestyle creep is real, and you'll probably find other things to spend your money on, no matter how much you make. The best way to invest more is to envision how that will benefit you and your loved ones. Every time I invest, I know I'm giving my future self a gift. I'm multiplying every single dollar I worked so hard to earn. Even in my 30s, I'm already reaping the rewards and seeing my account grow beyond six figures. Every investment is worth it, no matter how small. Want to share your early retirement story? Email Lauryn Haas at lhaas@businessinsider.com. Jump to"

            "full_content": "In the rapidly evolving Medtech industry, staying on top of growth strategies, including mergers and acquisitions (M&A)–related deal activity, is not just an advantage—it’s a necessity. For one leading MedTech company, Avanos Medical, the challenge was clear: streamline its corporate development and strategy workflows to drive innovation and maintain a competitive edge. The obstacle? A fragmented approach to market intelligence that slowed down decision making and obscured valuable insights. Avanos’s strategy team needed comprehensive, timely market data, including insights on private markets, and to swiftly navigate vast amounts of information across news, research, filings, and transcripts. With the quick pace of change in industries, news, and technology, dealmakers need to consume far more data, analyze it faster, and make precise decisions on strategy and M&A. Navigating Complex Data The MedTech company struggled with disparate data sources that were time-consuming to consolidate. This fragmentation of data sources led to delays in market analysis and made it difficult to identify viable investment opportunities and partnerships, particularly in the private markets. This often resulted in missed opportunities and deferred or delayed strategic decisions. “It’s always a challenge to find information on companies in a niche or emerging market,” says David Mornhinweg, Director of Corporate Development, Avanos Medical, “and even more challenging to find accurate and current information on potential acquisition targets, including management teams, size, and growth.” Insight at Every Data Point To address these challenges, Avanos implemented a robust solution offering in-depth market commentary and comprehensive data coverage. Avanos selected a product from a company that continually invests in its development, ensuring users can quickly and easily access relevant insights. Avanos also gained workflow benefits. The Corporate Development & Strategy team transformed the company’s workflows with three key improvements: 1. New and granular insights on private markets: Access to extensive private markets data enabled the company to discover and evaluate potential investment opportunities and partnerships that were previously under the radar. This new capability allowed Avanos to expand its reach and use emerging technologies and startups in the MedTech space. 2. Collaboration tools: The solution’s AI-powered Document Viewer tool streamlined the process of data analysis by allowing the team to view and annotate multiple documents within the platform and discover insights faster. The team also began using an advanced charting and forecasting tool, a robust Excel plug-in tool, and a library of 550+ templates, helping it facilitate quicker review cycles and improve collaboration to enhance its strategic decision making. 3.  In-depth aftermarket research: With advanced tools for investment and aftermarket research, Avanos gained insights into market trends, competitor activities, and potential risks. This comprehensive data supported more accurate forecasting and investment strategies better aligned with long-term business objectives. A Strategic Leap Forward It’s hard to find a solution with high-quality information on an easy-to-use platform, but Avanos now had one. “The new Market Maps for our target markets in health care allowed us to quickly identify major players, and the visuals made it easy to see deal trends across M&A and private capital funding,” Mornhinweg says. “I saved a ton of time using Document Viewer,” he says. “For example, when I open a transcript, I now have a high-level summary before digging into the text. I can also see all the companies mentioned, so I get a sense of important relationships, partnerships, areas of growth, and areas of risk.” The integration of this solution, S&P Capital IQ Pro, revolutionized Avanos’s market analysis and investment strategy workflows. The integration of private markets, Document Viewer, and investment/aftermarket research features into their workflows led to: • A significant reduction in time spent on data gathering and analysis, allowing the strategy team to focus on higher-value activities. • Improved accuracy of market forecasts and strategic decisions, leading to more successful investments and partnerships. • Enhanced collaboration and information sharing among team members, fostering a culture of informed decision making and proactive strategy formulation. Avanos Medical’s integration of an industry-leading market intelligence platform has transformed its corporate development and strategy workflows, enabling the team to navigate complex data landscapes. By streamlining market analysis and enhancing collaboration, Avanos can now make better, faster, more informed, and more strategic decisions to drive innovation and capitalize on emerging opportunities in the MedTech sector. This strategic leap forward positions Avanos for sustained growth and competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving market. Many other sectors can also benefit from similar technologies to enhance their data-driven decision-making processes. As industries increasingly rely on timely insights to navigate competitive landscapes, the adoption of advanced analytics solutions will be crucial for maintaining a strategic edge.

            "full_content": "Even when compared to the impressive and lengthy history of the University of Oxford, this week's gathering at Trinity College is noteworthy. Dozens of representatives from the biggest institutional investors in the world — the largest sovereign wealth funds, the most funded public pension plans, the most well-heeled foundations — are in the British university town through Thursday for Man Group's annual conference. The 10th iteration of the Man Alternative Investment Symposium starts Tuesday night with a drinks reception and private viewing at Oxford's Ashmolean Museum. Then it will dive into two days of speakers, including BBC broadcaster Tom Holland, nature walks, and more. It's an example of how the biggest asset managers in the world are growing more intertwined with their biggest backers. \"It's a look into how we interact with them,\" said Steven Desmyter, the president of the $178 billion Man Group, who leads the event planning for the conference. The conference comes at a strong point for Man: The firm's assets and revenues have jumped up so far this year, and first-half profits nearly doubled those of 2023, according to a midyear earnings report. The expectation now, he said, is their large, complex institutional clients want fewer but deeper relationships with external fund managers. This conference is a key part of how Man builds these with their clients. \"The interaction goes beyond just what is in our portfolios.\" The numbers The gathering might seem quaint compared to productions like Milken or Davos, but the manager has focused on quality over quantity. The attendance is capped — no more than 50 to 60 people from the firm's investors base attend each year, Desmyter said, but will represent roughly $25 trillion in institutional capital. Man also has around 60 of their own people come, with some flying in to hear the speakers — and their clients. \"We have the benefit of also attending,\" he said, explaining that portfolio managers rubbing shoulders with sovereign wealth heads is beneficial for each side. While Desmyter is proud of the agenda he puts together, he knows plenty of allocators also come to hear from their peers. \"Our investors span from Hawaii to Sydney, so it's truly a global group,\" he said. While the firm did not hold the conference in 2020, it only missed a year for the pandemic. He believes you can't replace the connection you get in person over a long period of time. \"There's a limit to video chats. I find if we don't have a set-up where there's a fixed agenda, it's only then when we can think a little more outside the box,\" he said. Academics, nerds, and rising stars The speakers over the two-plus days are roughly half Man employees and half external invitees. The firm looks for \"stars within their field,\" not necessarily the biggest names. \"We don't mind nerdiness, we are nerds ourselves,\" Desmyter said. Each year, there's a loose theme — past ones have been \"proof\" and \"data\" — and 2024 is no different. \"Decisions\" will be the motif of this year's confab, and external speakers include aforementioned BBC historian Holland, Morgan Stanley EMEA head Clare Woodman, political scientist John Curtice, and the cofounders of neuro11, a neuroscience-focused sports training firm. The roster of past speakers has a smattering of academics and authors, but also plenty of big names from finance and business, such as JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, and Mike Lynch, the billionaire British tech founder who died in August when his superyacht sank off of Italy's Sicilian coast. The firm balances the external speakers — from finance and other disciplines — with a line-up of Man executives and internal rising stars who are working on something that ties into the overall theme. For example, tech portfolio manager Sumant Wahi is speaking this year about \"new perspectives\" while Vinayak Kumar, an associate quantitative researcher for Man Numeric, is giving a presentation titled \"Rise of the machines: learning to decide.\" \"Innovative ideas come from all parts of the firm,\" said Desmyter, and while plenty of executives speak, the firm has historically tried to find people at all levels to present. Library stacks, not seafood towers Compared to the average investing conference, it's much more academic, which is fitting given Man's long-running relationship with Oxford, where the firm created the Oxford Man Institute in 2007 to research quant finance. \"The only logistical challenge is Oxford is not a conference place, it's a university town,\" Desmyter said. While the firm intentionally holds the conference before students return, there can still be trouble finding a venue. It's been in Rhodes House and Union House previously, and this year will be on Trinity College's grounds for the first time. Oxford offers plenty of advantages for the firm's leadership to get to know the decision makers at these firms. The relative remoteness — compared to New York or London or Dubai — means people can't leave for another meeting or a quick dinner. Everyone invited eats two dinners together, Desmyter said, and an optional walking tour around the grounds is typically well-attended. \"It's serene, not flashy,\" Desmyter said. As the conference has become more popular among the allocator set, Desmyter said he has had to make the hard call to decline extra representatives from different organizations to keep the gathering the appropriate size. \"This isn't Vegas,\" he said. The main focus, above all, for Man is to get to know their clients. \"It's really important to me that we are not trying to push product,\" Desmyter said. Jump to"

See at Amazon What makes this deal appealing is its timing and accessibility: while it comes in advance of the upcoming Prime Day event, this offer is available to all customers, not just Prime members, which makes it an inclusive opportunity for everyone to snag these top-tier earbuds at the best price ever seen for the latest generation AirPods Pro 2, which were released a year ago. The AirPods Pro 2 boast an impressive array of features that justify their popularity and premium status (see our review here). At the core of these earbuds is Apple’s advanced H2 chip which powers their superior sound quality and delivers deeper bass and crisper highs across all volume levels. The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) capability has seen a significant upgrade from its predecessor and offers twice the effectiveness in blocking out unwanted background noise. Comfort and fit are crucial aspects of any earbud design, and Apple has ensured the AirPods Pro 2 cater to a wide range of ear shapes: the package includes four sizes of flexible silicone ear tips (XS, S, M, L) so that you can easily to find your perfect fit. This customizable fit not only ensures comfort during extended wear but also helps create an optimal acoustic seal to optimize the noise cancellation effect. One of the standout features of the AirPods Pro 2 -that very few competitors have- is the Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking. This technology creates an immersive, three-dimensional listening experience tailored to the unique shape of the user’s ears and places sound elements precisely in space for a more engaging audio environment. The AirPods Pro 2 also introduce new user-friendly features like touch control that allows users to adjust volume with a simple swipe on the stem. The upgraded battery life offers up to 6 hours of listening time with Active Noise Cancellation enabled, extending to 30 hours when including the charging case. Speaking of which, the MagSafe Charging Case now includes a built-in speaker for easier location and a lanyard loop for added convenience. For those considering other options in Apple’s lineup, it’s worth noting that the company recently released the AirPods 4 which is available as a standard model at $129 and a version with Active Noise Cancellation for $179. However, the AirPods Pro 2 offer several advantages over these newer models including better noise isolation due to their in-ear design with silicone tips, superior water and dust resistance (IP54 vs IPX4), and generally better sound quality with more customization options. Considering the current Amazon discount brings the AirPods Pro 2 to a price point similar to the new AirPods 4 with ANC, opting for the Pro model represents a far better investment given their superior features and performance.

            "full_content": "Skeptics have been out in force since China rolled out aggressive stimulus measures last week to prop up its ailing economy and markets. It's just not enough to reverse the magnitude of China's problems — including an epic property crisis and high youth unemployment — they say. Still, traders, investors, and speculators have sent China's stock market to its best month in nearly a decade, signaling that the market players think that Beijing's moves are a \"bazooka.\" On Monday, mainland China's benchmark CSI 300 closed 8.5% higher, posting its biggest gain since 2008. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained as much as 4.2%. The gains are significant because the Chinese markets were in a prolonged market slump until last week's announcements. \"The PBoC and Politburo, all leaning in on putting a floor in property, boosting equities and backstopping households, have hit the right notes,\" Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho's macro research head for Asia excluding Japan, wrote in a note on Monday. The People's Bank of China's stock market stimulus was unusual. State media China Securities Journal explained the thinking behind the move in an editorial on Monday \"The capital market is not only a 'barometer' of the macroeconomy, but also a 'thermometer' of investor sentiment,\" said the editorial, which acknowledged the vicious cycle of negative feedback between the stock markets and economic sentiment. \"Boosting the capital market is an important breakthrough in strengthening confidence. An active stock market and improved investor confidence will improve expectations for economic development,\" the media outlet wrote. Chinese central bank governor Pan Gongsheng even said during his Tuesday announcement of the stimulus measures that authorities would consider injecting more liquidity into the system if stock market support measures from swaps and loans for share buybacks prove to be successful. Pan did not spell out the definition of success or put a limit to the amount of additional liquidity that authorities could inject, fueling euphoric hopes that the Chinese Communist Party could come close to throwing the kitchen sink. \"In other words, the state is actually telling investors that the Chinese stock market will not continue to decline, and China will provide 'unlimited ammunition' to support the stock market,\" Criss Wang, an independent analyst who publishes on the Smartkarma platform, wrote on Monday. Once the capital market is stabilized, overall sentiment would improve and boost the economy, she added. The PBOC's recent intervention is a \"clear departure from previous policy,\" wrote Global Data.TS Lombard economists wrote in a note last week. \"The bank, which usually cautions against speculation, now seeks to encourage it!\" they added. Whether such a strategy would work in the long run is a question mark, since China's economy faces significant fundamental challenges. China's factory activity shrank for a fifth straight month in September, official data showed on Monday. But the financial markets are fickle and trading increasingly automated, so there may be room for the rally to run. \"The sheer relief of coordinated China stimulus is manifesting as 'risk on' and can take on its own momentum,\" wrote Mizuho's Varathan. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange will be closed on Tuesday for a public holiday. Mainland China's stock markets will also be closed from Tuesday to Monday. Jump to"

            "full_content": "Eighty years after hundreds of allied soldiers parachuted from military aircraft into Nazi-occupied Netherlands as part of a daring World War Two offensive, their modern equivalents will on Saturday repeat the jump in commemoration.  In an airborne spectacular, 700 paratroopers from eight Nato nations - including the Netherlands, Germany, UK and US - will parachute from 12 aircraft.  The jump will be done in two waves and those involved will land at the same location at Ginkel Heath, near the Dutch town of Ede. Among them will be members of the parachute display team, the British Red Devils.  The airdrop is one of several events organised to mark the anniversary of Operation Market Garden, an ambitious military offensive designed to speed up the invasion of Nazi Germany and shorten the war in Europe.  Among those who parachuted into the Netherlands were 1,900 allied airborne soldiers from Britain's 4th Parachute Brigade.  It combined one of the largest airborne assaults in history, known as \"Market\", with a ground offensive, \"Garden\", aimed at swiftly capturing key bridges over the Rhine River. Immortalised by the everyday phrase \"a bridge too far\", the failure to secure a final bridge at Arnhem was the result of stronger-than-anticipated German resistance, logistical setbacks and tactical decisions by Allied commanders. Two British soldiers killed in Operation Market Garden were laid to rest earlier this week with full military honours in the Oosterbeek war graves cemetery, close to Ginkel Heath. Their coffins were dressed in Union Flags and carried by military bearer parties. Private Henry Moon, 7th Battalion, The Green Howards, was part of the ground offensive and was killed at the age of 21. His remains were identified through a DNA match. It was a humbling moment, his great-nephew David Snowdon told the BBC, to see hundreds of people turn out to pay their respects. Lieutenant Dermod Green Anderson, a glider pilot who landed with his troops in a village northwest of Arnhem, was killed when an enemy shell exploded near his trench just hours before the evacuation order came. His great-nephew, Lieutenant Colonel Julian Anderson, watched as his wooden coffin was gently lowered into a freshly dug grave - stunned to discover his great-uncle’s body had lain undetected for decades nearby. Many of the thatched roof villas and apartments around Arnhem display the merlot flag decorated with a leaping pegasus, dedicated to the British Airborne forces, to ensure the sacrifices made for their freedom are not forgotten. Some of the most ferocious fighting took place on these tranquil, tree-lined streets during the eight-day battle. The battles were so incongruously bloody that those who witnessed war on their doorsteps recalled taking refuge from the relentless gunfire and described the paratroopers dropping like \"stars falling from the sky’\" The area was eventually swarmed by victorious Nazi soldiers and became one of the last places to be liberated from the Nazis. This eastern Dutch region has long maintained its traditions as a heartland of Allied remembrance. So, why do the Dutch still put such great emphasis on remembering the failed Allied effort? Earlier this month, the BBC sought answers from walkers on ‘Wandeltocht’ - the world's largest one-day commemorative march that follows the footsteps of the Allied forces, passing key historical landmarks. Thirty-four thousand people armed only with water bottles took part in the annual tribute, which encourages young and old to engage with history in a meaningful way. As living memory passes with the remaining veterans, the Dutch feel a responsibility to share these stories and ensure their legacy is maintained. Mattijs van Gessel’s sons Koen and Tom are hiding shyly behind his shorts. Their mother Sary told the BBC it was an opportunity to educate them. \"Wars take place everywhere and we tell them our safety is not something that you can take for granted,\" she said.  That morning, during breakfast, Sary said the family had discussed why all the military personnel were in the village.  \"If this wasn’t happening then we wouldn’t be talking about it.\" One gentleman, Geert, told me he had goosebumps on the walk. His adopted grandfather was wounded by a piece of shrapnel and was tended to by two Dutch nurses. The shrapnel and his beret are on display in the Oosterbeek museum.  \"We would like to take it back for the family but it is more important for the world to see the evidence. It’s most important for kids to know it was real,\" Geert said.  Another participant, Amanda Juanita Diemel, told the BBC that they were \"walking with history\". \"It makes it very concrete, very tangible,\" she said.  \"It’s important to keep it alive, to learn from the past, especially with everything going on in the world today.\" As weeks of commemorations to mark the 80th anniversary of Operation Market Garden draw to a close, these moments have caused people to pause and remember the price paid to restore peace in Europe. Witness History - Operation Market Garden  Thousands of Allied troops parachuted into Nazi-occupied Holland in September 1944. It was the most ambitious Allied airborne offensive of World War Two. The BBC World Service hears from Hetty Bischoff van Heemskerck, a young Dutch woman from the city of Arnhem, who watched the Allied paratroopers come down. The Wedgwood Institute is falling into further disrepair and is deemed at risk by heritage officials. Kevin Preston's artwork disappeared from Stoke Village in Plymouth in the last week. The damage sustained in World War Two is to be preserved as part of major repairs to the walkway. A new study shines light on a hotly contested centuries-old mystery.

            "full_content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Ambition is not a dirty word—especially if you’re Bertrand Piccard. The explorer, psychiatrist, and environmentalist aims to “promote sustainability through spectacular actions” to prove that a cleaner future is possible. During 2015 and 2016, he famously circumnavigated the globe in a solar-powered airplane, Solar Impulse, to show off the potential of renewables. But even more ambitious was what he attempted after he landed. He tasked his foundation with demonstrating that environmental protection and economic profit can go hand in hand. The goal was to find 1,000 interventions that can protect the planet while also making money, shattering the argument that pursuing sustainability must come at a cost. “The goal is really to show that we can be much more efficient, that we can develop the economy, but in a clean way,” Piccard says. It’s going well. Since the foundation started its project eight years ago, it has logged 1,650 solutions—processes, products, materials, and devices—that can make an environmental difference at a profit. They encompass nearly every field—from water and energy to agriculture and IT—and the foundation is working to bring them to governments, cities, and businesses. Ahead of speaking at the WIRED x Octopus Energy Tech Summit in Berlin on October 10, Piccard sat down with WIRED to discuss how Solar Impulse’s program works, who’s responsible for making positive change happen, and why the narrative around net zero needs to change. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. WIRED: Tell us about these profitable solutions. They sound almost too good to be true. Bertrand Piccard: Sure. To be selected, a solution needs to exist already. And it needs to be credible, scalable, and profitable, and to protect the environment. So for example, there is a system of steel staples produced by a Belgian company called Bekaert. Mix these inside concrete when building and you don’t need all these heavy and expensive iron armatures. With the staples you keep the concrete more compact and end up using less concrete and metal, producing less CO2 and pollution, and making more profit. Another example are LED lamps that you can use for public lighting, where you can have a solar panel and battery. The lighting is then off-grid. You don’t need to dig along the street to put in wires. If you do that, you save 37 percent of the energy bill of the city. You have interesting ways to take the unrecyclable waste of a city and turn it into construction stones. You have ways to recover the lost heat from factory chimneys and give it back to the factory—it’s then 20 to 40 percent less on the energy bill. In a city, you can dig channels for geothermal heat, and connect big buildings with heat pumps in the center of the city to this network. This was not possible five years ago; now you can do it. Once you’ve discovered these ideas, how do you get them adopted? Is it about spreading knowledge? Providing funding? We give our label—the Solar Impulse Efficient Solution label—to those that deserve it. It’s the only label that certifies the economic profitability of an ecological product, material, system, or device. This helps these companies developing solutions find investors, customers, and partners. We help the companies directly, too. We put them in contact with investors. We also have created two investment funds, with BNP Paribas and Rothschild Five Arrows, to bring investments in to help companies develop. We also organize meetings between public authorities and innovators, so that companies can find customers—we bring together the people providing solutions with those needing them. This approach suggests we can innovate our way out of trouble, but some argue that behavior change is really what’s needed to stop environmental destruction. Flying is a good example—that instead of banking on carbon-free flights becoming possible, some say we should just fly less. What do you think of this argument? I think we need to always reconcile both ways of thinking. You have to clearly degrow pollution, waste, and consumption of resources and energy. But you cannot degrow the economy. You need to pay for education, health, social protection. It can seem to be a paradox—but it’s not. We are in a quantitative economy where we produce and waste too much. We need to move to a qualitative economy, where you replace what is polluting with what is protecting the environment, by selling efficiency. If you sell systems that reabsorb the heat from the chimney or public parking or subways to heat houses, you save energy, but at the same time, you create jobs and you help startups to develop. What you always have to aim for is efficiency: Do better with less. This is possible in a lot of fields. Now, you asked me a specific question about aviation. There is too much consumption here because the cost is so low. A lot of people fly because it is cheap. And again, we have massive quantitative consumption. We have to go back to a more selective, qualitative way of flying. But at the same time, we need to develop decarbonized aviation, because the world is not ready to stop flying completely. What other big areas still need grappling with? There are solutions for every field, but the problem is we don’t use them. You can have construction that is almost carbon-neutral, but a lot of buildings are still made in an old-fashioned way. Decarbonization of construction is completely possible, but you need 10 percent more investment at the beginning. Of course, you recover this over the years because the operating costs are much lower. But you need a model where constructors receive an incentive to build with higher initial investment to the lower operating cost. Mobility can be electric. But to really justify electric cars that drive only 5 percent of the day, you need to use their batteries to store energy off the grid, and then when there’s a peak of demand, have them discharge their batteries. For this, you need to clearly give an advantage to all EV drivers to be able to store energy and sell it back to the grid. This is not done yet. You could use data centers to heat a city. But it’s not done. So everywhere, solutions exist, and we need to push the knowledge that these solutions are profitable, they exist, and they protect the environment. What role do governments play in this? It is still allowed today to be inefficient. It’s still allowed to put CO2 in the atmosphere and plastic into the oceans. So, we need to modernize the legal framework in order to really push the legal need to be efficient. If it is a necessity to use all these solutions, people will use them, and they will come much more onto the market and it will help the startups grow, produce all these solutions for everybody, and it will be a major advantage. So governments have a very important responsibility. What about finance? That must be important too. Something that’s key, I think, are new business models that sell use and not property. So, for example, you have people who want to install a heat pump system in a building—they will make a contract with a producer of heat pumps to buy heat over 20 years, but the pump still belongs to the producer, not the final client, which means that there needs to be a financial institution that pays for it. And this is a business opportunity. There will be much more leasing than direct sales in the future. Another example that I love very much is a company called Pragma Charge. Big transport companies usually use diesel trucks; Pragma Charge, instead of trying to sell these companies replacement EVs, which are more expensive, sells a service: kilometers of transport with electric trucks. So the company doesn’t have to handle the energy transition, it just gets the final product? Exactly, yes. India has done it too with electric buses. The government has bought 50,000 electric buses and put them in different cities and villages. But these places don’t have to buy the vehicles, they only buy the kilometers driven—and this works out 25 percent cheaper than it would be using diesel buses. We have the goal of getting to net zero by 2050. How confident are you that we’ve got the tools to achieve this? We are not on the path to get there. And I think the narrative used is wrong. We hear it’s going to be difficult. We hear it’s going to be expensive, that people will have to make sacrifices and renounce a part of their comfort and mobility. I think it’s the wrong narrative because it is not attractive. In Europe, a lot of political parties and individuals are resisting this goal of decarbonization, thinking it’s detrimental for them, for their business. But if instead you tell people we are going to modernize our country, have more efficient infrastructure and systems, they will be enthusiastic. Instead of speaking of the cost of the energy transition, you have to speak about the profitable investment, new jobs, new business opportunities. People need to understand that it will be an advantage, it gives a better quality of life. We really have to present it this way, otherwise we will miss the target. Finally, what’s next for you? I’m launching a new project, which is about flying around the world with a hydrogen-powered airplane. It’s very good to speak about solutions, but to actually make solutions known, we need to attract people’s interest. And in climate action, we also need to restore hope. For that, we have to go beyond the obvious, get out of our comfort zone, and really start to work clearly on new technologies. I believe hydrogen has a future for heavy transport, where batteries would be too heavy. But it’s not enough to say it—we have to demonstrate it. If we manage to fly around the world nonstop with a hydrogen-powered airplane, people will want to do more with hydrogen. It will make hydrogen more popular. And this is what we need, because today, it’s niche. There’s not enough demand because there’s not enough offer, and there’s not enough offer because there’s not enough demand. The plane now is under construction. It’s called Climate Impulse. It should make a test flight in 2026, and then hopefully fly nonstop around the world, with zero emissions, in 2028.

            "full_content": "A woman whose twin sister died in crash on a County Tyrone road before it was upgraded has said she believes new investment in the A5 will save lives. Natasha Murray was 16 when a lorry crashed into her school bus on the A4 road in 2008, before the road was improved. Her sister Nicola lost her life in the collision and soon after that, the stretch of road between Dungannon and Ballygawley received a new dual carriageway. After that work, fatalities on the road dramatically reduced. The A4 leads onto the A5, which links County Tyrone and Londonderry, and that road has seen 57 road deaths recorded on it since 2006. A plan for a new A5 dual carriageway was first proposed nearly 20 years ago and on Wednesday the infrastructure minister announced part of the construction of dual carriageway was going ahead. John O’Dowd said that work on the project would begin in early 2025 and would be completed on a phased basis. Phase one of the scheme will be between Strabane and Ballygawley in County Tyrone, where many of the deaths and injuries had taken place on the road. Reacting to the news Natasha said it was “bittersweet” and has also called for the full route to be upgraded to a dual carriageway. She said: “My sister lost her life on a road that was very similar and just as dangerous as the A5, it was quickly made safer and that’s why I feel so strongly about the A5. “Obviously I think the A5 upgrade going ahead is positive, but it shouldn’t have taken so long.  \"People have lost their lives waiting for this road to be upgraded.”  Natasha has previously described how she held her sister as people tried to save her life. She said: “It’s 16 years on from the accident, so Nicola is now gone as long as she was here and some days I still wake up and actually don’t believe she died. “I was able to walk away from the accident that day, and I never take that for granted, I just try and do her justice by living my life to the full and she is part of my family’s daily conversations, so she is very much alive in that sense. “ The A4 route from Dungannon to Ballygawley where Nicola died was upgraded to a dual carriageway in November 2010. Since then Natasha and her family have supported the campaign to get a similar upgrade to the A5, a road she can see from her living room window. She said: “Getting the upgrade to the A4 did bring comfort to me and my family, knowing that it was safer, and I have always wanted that for the families impacted by deaths on the A5. “The A4 dual carriageway is now a road that is fully equipped to deal with the volume of traffic travelling on it, where as the A5 as it currently is, there is zero margin for error, so an upgrade is long overdue.” Approximately 1,200 hectares of land, impacting more than 300 working farms would be required for the construction of the full 85km A5 carriageway. Groups like the Alternative A5 Alliance (AA5A) have repeatedly raised concerns about losing land that has been in their families for generations. They had called for the existing A5 road to be improved and pointed to the environmental impact of constructing such a large-scale project, as well as unresolved issues about building the new road near potential flood plains. Meanwhile, police figures have shed light on the cause of crashes on the A5, putting focus on driver responsibility. Driver error is the most common cause of fatal road traffic accidents on the A5, but it is also the most common cause of fatal accidents on the majority of roads across Northern Ireland. Meanwhile a previous investigation by BBC News NI found that between 2012 and 2024, the A5 had the highest rate of deaths per kilometre of any road in Northern Ireland. Natasha Murray said she understood the concerns around construction of a new A5, but believes the success of the A4 dual carriageway is evidence of what can be achieved. Figures show that there were 37 fatalities on the A4 road in the 10 years before an upgraded dual carriageway opened in 2010. Following the upgrade and between 2011 and 2018, there were two fatalities on the new A4 dual carriageway “I’m not naïve in thinking that human error doesn’t come into this,\" said Natasha. \"But the evidence shows that the consequences of having an accident on the A5 as it is are much more severe,\" she added. “I understand there have been objections around environmental and land concerns, but I will always come from a perspective that a life is always more important than anything else.” The Alternative A5 Alliance said it would comment further when it had full sight of the Public Appeals Commission's recommendations regarding the A5.  The Education Minister Paul Givan has declined 205 meetings since taking office. The awning, which is the subject of an investigation by the local council, was taken down on Monday. Figures are showing a drop in unemployment rate and uptake in the number of people on company payrolls The principal pressures are land use change and pollution, closely linked to agricultural intensification.

            "full_content": "China's stock rally isn't over — and the nation could have the perfect cocktail of ingredients to stage a monster run-up over the next year, according to one Wall Street forecaster. Jeff deGraaf, the CEO of Renaissance Macro Research, says he sees China's benchmark stock index climbing to 6,000 over the next year. That implies a 54% increase from the CSI 300's current levels, thanks to the right mix of conditions in Beijing that should power equities higher, he told Bloomberg on Friday. \"Skepticism, valuation, stimulus, momentum and a trend change,\" deGraaf said of China's investing environment, adding that it was \"one of the best set-ups\" he's seen over his 35-year career. Chinese stocks have been on a roller coaster in recent weeks after Beijing announced its latest monetary stimulus package, which included lowering interest rates and pumping the stock market with $114 billion. The package sparked the steepest rally in Chinese stocks since 2008 before it quickly fizzled, a sign investors were disappointed Beijing didn't announce more stimulus measures. Markets, though, are expecting the nation to announce a fresh fiscal stimulus package at a briefing on Saturday, potentially reviving the bull case for stocks. Most investors expect China to add 2 trillion yuan, or $283 billion, in fiscal stimulus through 2025, according to a Bloomberg poll of market participants. \"We see the policy response as self-preservation, a reaction to the weakness and a potential Mario Draghi-esque 'Do what it takes' moment for China,\" deGraaf said, later urging investors to \"keep stops in place\" when betting on Chinese stocks. Other traders on Wall Street have shown interest in buying the dip in Chinese equities, despite fear that Beijing's economic slowdown could stick around. Investors poured a record $39.1 billion into Chinese stock funds in the week ending October 9, according to EPFR Global data cited by Bank of America in a note. \"We buy any China dips,\" BofA strategist Michael Hartnett wrote in a note. Stimulus efforts will continue to \"be used aggressively to boost domestic animal spirits and demand,\" he added. Additionally, the Shenzhen Huaan Hexin Private Investment Fund Management Co., a Chinese hedge fund up 800% since 2017, also says it's buying the dip in technology stocks listed in Hong Kong. The Hang Seng Index has dropped 3% over the last five trading days, but is still up 27% from levels at the start of the year. \"Such a correction is more like a buying opportunity,\" Yuan Wei, the fund's founder, said in an interview with Bloomberg this week. \"If you compare to their fundamentals, the stocks remain very cheap.\" China's onshore market has a 50% chance of starting a new bull run, as opposed to a short-term bounce, and the bear market in equities should be over by now, Yuan said. \"The market is just rebounding from an extremely bearish level to a level that's still undervalued,\" he later added. Other strategists on Wall Street have made bullish calls on Chinese equities in recent weeks, with eyes on continued stimulus measures in Beijing. Goldman Sachs predicted China's stock market could rally another 20%, thanks to \"more substantial policy measures\" and Chinese stocks being oversold, strategists said in a note.

            "full_content": "Peter Kafka, Chief Correspondent covering media and technology Oracle stock is on a tear. Shares of the business software company shot up 5% on Monday and are up 64% for the year. The Oracle boom is directly tied to the AI boom. Even though investors are starting to wonder about all the money companies like Google are spending on AI, they are excited about what all that spending means for Oracle's cloud and database revenue. But those numbers are kind of abstract to most people. And lots of people don't really care about enterprise software or AI bills. So let's put it in context: The Oracle boom means that Larry Ellison, one of the world's richest men, is now much, much richer. Ellison, who co-founded Oracle, owns 40% of the company. Over the past two years, Ellison's net worth has more than doubled — from $80 billion to $181 billion. And here's more context for people who care about media, and Hollywood: Ellison, who is financing the purchase of Paramount for his son, David, has already made enough money this week to cover the entire bill. Larry Ellison, along with private equity firm RedBird Capital, is buying Paramount via a complicated transaction. The cost: $8.4 billion. When the deal closes, Ellison will control 77.5% of the troubled Hollywood studio and TV conglomerate. His total investment will reportedly be around $6 billion. And on Monday, a 5% jump in Oracle stock raised Ellison's net worth by $7 billion. That's enough to fund the whole deal, plus several hundred million in walking-around money. One more note: The Oracle boom also helps contextualize Ellison's investment in Elon Musk's version of Twitter, and explains why Ellison doesn't seem to care that the $1 billion he put into Musk's adventure in 2022 is now likely worth much, much less. And anyway, what's a billion dollars between two longtime pals who happen to be two of the richest men in the world? Musk was staying at Ellison's estate in Hawaii — Ellison owns almost all of the island of Lanai — as he was preparing to buy Twitter a couple of years ago. And the two men seem to be doing just fine now. Ellison says he recently had dinner with Musk and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang — another one of the world's richest men. They talked about AI, of course.

            "full_content": "Shares of Trump Media have plunged 70% since the company went public in March. Even after that sell-off, it's carrying a market value of roughly $3 billion, a figure one expert says is still too high. \"According to Bloomberg data they had sales of $837,000 last quarter and a net loss of $16.4 million. The numbers don't jive,\" Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, told Business Insider. He added that its current valuation \"seems unjustifiable.\" One traditional valuation metric — price-to-sales ratio — is currently at 1,864 times, with the company generating revenue of less than $2 million in the trailing twelve months. In addition to the eye-watering valuation, Woods said Truth Social's growth has limited upside due to its political nature. \"They struggle with user retention and growth and the upside seems limited — especially if he loses the election,\" Woods said. \"His relevance and age will play a role as will the fact that this never became the social playground for anything outside of politics.\" Another lingering issue weighing down Truth Social stock is Trump's increasingly frequent use of its biggest competitor, X, formerly known as Twitter. There's also the recent end of a lock-up period for insiders to sell shares, which could put further pressure on shares. The offloading has already begun, with United Atlantic Ventures — an investment partnership run by two former contestants of Trump's \"Apprentice\" reality show — dumping nearly their entire 11-million-share stake in the company for proceeds exceeding $100 million. There's also the risk that Trump himself will decide to sell some or all of his 57% ownership stake, although he's previously said he won't do so. But there's no guarantee he won't change his mind. \"If there was to be a fire sale by its number one shareholder, that could cause a panic with other insiders holding shares and lead to a major leg lower,\" Woods said.

            "full_content": "This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with Carla Hoppe, 40, who left her Big Four career and founded Wealthbrite, a UK-based financial literacy company. Business Insider verified her past employment at PwC and EY with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity. I started my career as a solicitor and worked at PwC as part of their legal team in the UK. A few years into my career, I relocated to the US and became a tax advisor at the company. Roughly a year later, in 2014, I moved back to the UK and continued working at PwC until 2018, when I left for EY working as a director on the international tax and transaction services team. From my early days at PwC, I felt Big Four businesses operate super efficiently and do fantastic work. Still, the system had some creaks regarding financial literacy and business acumen. Through the work I did, which included demystifying the tax world for ordinary people, I noticed this was not just a problem among the people working at PwC but more broadly across the nation. Those experiences led me to create Wealthbrite, which I founded in 2021 after leaving EY in August 2020. We work with organizations to support their early career talent, providing them with training on navigating uncertainties around personal financial literacy and how businesses work. Here are three of the biggest financial mistakes I've seen Big Four peers and other professionals making and my tips on how to avoid them: Lifestyle inflation can look like spending all your earnings, or even more than what you're earning, to maintain a certain lifestyle. I've had conversations with friends and colleagues who've felt pressured in this way. When you work hard and long hours, sometimes you want to reward yourself.  This can look like spending money or splurging and overspending to make up for working long hours or not enjoying your day job as much as you'd like. I've probably done this myself in the early days of my career. I remember getting really excited after finishing professional exams and qualifying as a lawyer because it came with a bump in pay. It felt like I could have a bit more fun with the money I was earning. Lifestyle inflation often happens because people don't take the time to budget. I've spoken to many people, not just in the Big Four but also in other professional services, and know that many aren't actively budgeting. It wasn't common for my Big Four colleagues to talk about financial goals, but I had chats with people down the pub when they'd complain about the cost of things or confess to a spending splurge. After I left PwC and started talking about Wealthbrite, more former colleagues opened up. Some even confessed to deeper financial trouble, including large credit card debts. When you aren't paying attention to what's going in and out of your bank account, it's easy to fall into a habit of splurging and not realizing you're spending beyond your means. You can have fun with your money, but it's important to budget and set financial goals. I encourage people to identify short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals and give yourself the opportunity to make those goals a reality. By the time I qualified as a lawyer, I was earning more than my father ever had in his career. It meant I didn't feel super comfortable talking to family members about my financial situation. I'd never heard the word \"investing\" growing up. I also didn't feel comfortable speaking with colleagues about finances. One of the most damaging impacts was not making the most of my pension early in my career. I've spoken to friends across multiple industries who admit they did the same. Maximizing pension contributions is probably my No. 1 investment tip for people in workplaces like mine. More often than not, you're given very generous pension offerings, both in terms of the levels of contributions you can make and that your employer can make. Not maximizing that is a big mistake. I've spoken to many peers who are now at senior levels in the Big Four or law careers, who know they are now at the top end of the income spectrum and should probably speak to a financial advisor. Still, they don't do it because it feels like life admin. Not everybody makes partner, and not everyone stays in the profession. People choose to leave or take a break for personal reasons. When they do, investments can help them continue to afford their lifestyle beyond their time in that job. I think there are a few questions people can ask themselves to work out whether seeking external support from an advisor is right for them. Do they have the time and appetite to learn about finances in ways that will help them maximize their financial position? And do they have the level of expertise to do that? When you're working at Big Four companies, there are all sorts of rules and regulations about the types of investments you're allowed to make because of audit restrictions. It can get messy and complicated, so it may make sense to bring in external support to help you navigate that. When I was working at Big Four companies, talking about finances really wasn't done at all outside those key times in the year when we'd talk about promotions, pay raises, and benefits. In fields like law or the Big Four, you specialize really early on. You become an expert in your field. The culture becomes one where you're expected to know what's going on, and it can feel like if you don't know something, you're at a disadvantage. This is compounded when you deal with a topic like financial health, which many consider a social taboo. Organizations need to make it easier for people to come forward and say they are struggling with financial health and well-being. I think financial well-being has become a bigger conversation in the UK following COVID-19 and the nationwide cost-of-living crisis. Gen Zers are also much more open about money conversations than previous generations. I recommend that early career professionals talk to their peers about what works for them from a personal finance position. I'd also encourage organizations to teach people about the language of money and finance and make that part of their everyday business practices. Employers owe people a duty of care when it comes to helping them really understand their pay and financial benefits. Jump to"

The central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, which will make it cheaper to get a car loan, finance a business or carry a balance on your credit card. Wednesday's rate cut is the Fed's first since 2020, but it won't be the last. On average, members of the Fed's rate-setting committee expect borrowing costs to drop by another half a percentage point this year and an additional full point next year. That's a more rapid decline than committee members were projecting just three months ago.   The shift to lowering interest rates marks a major turning point in the Fed's two-and-a-half-year battle to curb inflation. The central bank began raising rates in March 2022 in an effort to tamp down demand and bring prices under control. By last summer, interest rates had climbed to between 5.25% and 5.5%, their highest level in more than two decades.  The rate cut on Wednesday comes as the annual inflation rate has fallen sharply, to 2.5% last month, from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022.  “We’re not saying ‘Mission Accomplished’ or anything like that,\" Fed chairman Jerome Powell told reporters after the decision was announced. \"I have to say, though, we’re encouraged by the progress we have made.” At the same time, job growth has slowed and the unemployment rate has inched up to 4.2%, leaving Fed officials worried that high interest rates could become an unnecessary drag on the economy.  \"The U.S. economy is in a good place,\" Powell said. \"And our decision today is designed to keep it there.\" The pace of future rate cuts is still uncertain, however. One member of the committee, Michelle Bowman, wanted to proceed more cautiously on Wednesday, cutting the benchmark rate by just a quarter percentage point. Committee members are divided on how much further rates will need to fall next year.  While falling interest rates will help borrowers and potentially spur economic growth, they come with a cost for savers. The interest paid for online savings accounts and money market funds will likely decline. The timing of the Fed's move is politically sensitive, coming less than seven weeks before a presidential election in which the strength of the economy is a key issue for voters. Powell has said repeatedly that he and his colleagues are not swayed by partisan politics. “Our job is to support the economy on behalf of the American people,\" Powell said. \"And if we get it right, this will benefit the American people very significantly. So we don’t put up any other filters. If you start doing that, I don’t know where you stop.”   Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor"

            "full_content": "In years to come, Silicon Valley may view the events of the past few weeks as the moment the generative AI boom got too frothy.  Investors spent the summer wondering if top AI stocks could continue to justify soaring valuations in the face of absent returns from their massive AI spending. Now, signs have emerged that they're not yet done with generative AI mania. As September rolled into October, some of the most significant investment areas in AI received fresh votes of confidence — be it in the chip space, the large language model arena, and devices.  But there could be reason to feel cautious about the latest developments. Cerebras, a chip startup, included an eyebrow-raising detail in its IPO prospectus. But first, here's a quick primer on the Sunnyvale-based company.  Founded in 2015, Cerebras aims to accelerate AI development by designing processors to train and deploy smarter LLMs. It believes these processors, among other offerings, can compete with the powerful chips sold by Nvidia. That's no walk in the park. Nvidia has emerged as one of the biggest winners of the generative AI boom, having grown from a market capitalization of $364 billion at the start of 2023 to over $3 trillion. As things stand, however, Cerebras' plan to take it on involves generating the vast majority of its revenue from just one customer: Abu Dhabi-based AI firm G42. According to its IPO prospectus, Cerebras — backed by investment firms such as Altimeter, Benchmark, and Coatue — generated 83% of its $78.6 million revenue in 2023 and 87% of the $136.4 million revenue generated in the first half of 2024 from G42. Founded in 2018, G42 has emerged as one of the Middle East's biggest AI opportunities. Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala, owns a stake, as do Microsoft and the private equity firm Silver Lake. There appears to be reason to work with G42, then, but by Cerebras' admission, an \"adverse\" change in the relationship could harm the chip firm. While Cerebras has sought to strengthen its customer base — it reached an agreement with oil giant Saudi Aramco in September — its revenue concentration will weigh on investors as it aims to raise $1 billion in its public listing at a $7 billion to $8 billion valuation, per Bloomberg. Warning signals emerged elsewhere as OpenAI shook up the market for LLMs on Wednesday by closing the most valuable funding round in Silicon Valley history. While the ChatGPT maker announced that it had raised $6.6 billion at a $157 billion valuation from a series of new and existing investors, it did so with a few notable asterisks. For one, per the Financial Times, OpenAI has asked its investors not to back its rivals, which include Anthropic, Elon Musk's xAI, and Safe Superintelligence (SSI), the startup founded in June by OpenAI's former chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever. While it has the right to do this, the ask is unusual in the world of startup investing, where venture capitalists often spread their bets. Gary Marcus, a professor who testified next to OpenAI's Sam Altman at a Congress hearing in 2023, described the move as OpenAI \"running scared.\" David Sacks, general partner at Craft Ventures, called the ask a \"shady\" one. \"The mask is really coming off,\" he wrote on X. It is also worth taking a closer look at some of the investors in its latest round. As my colleague Darius Rafieyan noted earlier this week, some of the most \"prolific bubble chasers\" — investors with a track record of betting on companies close to their peak — now count themselves as OpenAI backers. Think SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate that burned billions of dollars on WeWork, and Tiger Global, an investment fund that suffered brutal losses in recent years after going on huge startup betting sprees. This has taken place against a backdrop of wider challenges. OpenAI no longer has a chief technology officer after Mira Murati quit the firm late last month, becoming the latest top-tier executive to depart. The company has also been battling to reverse its lossmaking operations. According to a September report from The New York Times, OpenAI's monthly revenue grew to $300 million in August —but it has projected $5 billion in losses this year. The other notable sign of market frothiness came as Mark Zuckerberg unveiled a bold new wearable device for the AI era: Meta's Orion. The augmented reality glasses, introduced at the company's Connect conference in late September, put AI front and center by embedding the technology in a way that \"can sense and understand the world around you,\" according to Meta. While they have impressed — Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang gave a glowing endorsement of the wearables in a promotional video, and Meta's stock responded positively after the event — there are a few matters to consider beyond the hype for it. The first is cost. According to The Verge's Alex Heath, who spoke to Meta executives, the cost of building a single Orion unit at present is a steep $10,000. Even if that cost can be brought down — something Orion lead Rahul Prasad told The Verge would be a focus of the device's next development phase — Meta will need to contend with the fact that appetite for these wearables hasn't exactly impressed in the past. Meta rival Snapchat took a go at introducing glasses to the market in the mid-2010s but failed to make a splash after incurring a $40 million loss on them. It is taking another crack with AI-embedded eyewear, announcing a partnership last month with OpenAI to embed its tech. Other form factors for AI that have emerged recently, such as the Humane AI pin that launched in April and the pocketable rabbit R1 introduced in January, have largely flopped, too. Where does this leave us? In short, a lossmaking startup must justify its $157 billion valuation. A chip firm worth up to $8 billion must persuade investors not to worry about its undiversified revenue streams. Meta will need to convince consumers to switch to another way of interacting with AI entirely.  All of these things may come to pass. If so, this will be seen as a juncture where AI goes on to truly revolutionize the industries it touches — and repay the faith of investors. But if history is anything to go by, the high-stakes tech world is rarely plain sailing.      Jump to"

            "full_content": "This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with Armand Arton, 47, president of Arton Capital, a financial advisory firm, about golden visas and passports. The following has been edited for length and clarity. I founded Arton Capital in 2006. We advise governments on how to attract wealthy global citizens to their countries through residence-by-investment programs, and we also have a private client division where we advise ultra-high and high-net-worth families about how to obtain residencies in other countries. Our clients are based all over the world. Some have relocation needs because they're in a country where lives are in danger, while for others, it's more of a lifestyle decision. They want mobility to access more countries worldwide. We advise them about golden visas and golden passports — government programs that offer residency or citizenship rights to foreign investors. When I first entered this industry nearly 20 years ago, the perception was that people living in the East wanted to move west. But in recent years, migration has been happening in all directions.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, many American investors couldn't enter Europe, so they are now looking for residency programs in European countries. After this year's elections in France and the UK, we're also seeing millionaires in those countries looking to relocate. Here are the top five countries that my clients, who are looking to relocate through investment, are interested in moving to: In 2013, Hungary launched a program granting citizenship in exchange for investing in government bonds, with the promise of repayment after five years. They decided to reopen it this year with an additional focus on real estate investment. It comes with a residency card that can be renewed after 10 years. Hungary offers a European lifestyle, is safe, and offers huge opportunities to invest in real estate. Unlike countries like Portugal and Spain that want to abolish or redirect funds away from the property sector, Hungary encourages people to invest in real estate. Property in Hungary is relatively inexpensive, which creates opportunities for investors. Hungary also has a stable political ecosystem. Governments haven't changed as rapidly as in Greece or Italy. There's an option to apply for a passport in Hungary, but you will have to reside in Hungary for eight consecutive years and pass a test in the local language. Because Hungary has just relaunched its program, there's a lot of hype around it, but recently, I've been seeing more people invest in Greece. Greece's program stipulated a 250,000 euro minimum investment in real estate, but recently, the government announced it would increase the price to 400,000 euros. This came into effect at the start of September. We saw a surge in clients applying for visas in Greece because everyone got their applications in before the price hike. We don't expect demand to slow down. The opportunity for easy access to Greece's storied cities, beaches, and culture will never lose its appeal, whatever the price. Greece is a popular tourist destination, so clients buy properties they can rent out for income. A golden visa in Greece does not automatically confer the right to work. Instead of being employed by others, investors can establish and own a business in the country. This can benefit Greek citizens, who can seek employement by the companies that golden visa applicants establish. Similarly to Hungary, there's a flexible long-term residence pathway that offers access to the Schengen area, a border-free zone of 29 European countries where citizens and residents can travel easily. To obtain citizenship in Greece, you must have resided in the country for seven years and passed Greek language and cultural knowledge tests. I've found that for people applying for residency by investment, citizenship is a possibility but not the end goal. A permanent residency in a European country gives them similar rights to citizens. Italy's program has been under the radar for a long time. The program requires investment directly into the economy, such as the stock market, instead of real estate. It's not been as popular because it doesn't have a real estate option. However, since Brexit created instability in Europe, Italy has become a more popular destination among ultrawealthy people already in Europe. This is thanks to its amazing tax package for anyone who decides to live in Italy and become a permanent resident. Until August 2024, foreign income, with some exceptions, was taxed at a flat rate of 100,000 euros a year for 15 years for applicants who became tax-paying residents of Italy. This has now been doubled to 200,000 euros per year on foreign worldwide income. We've noticed demand from people in other European countries such as England, France, and Germany, eager to take advantage of the 15-year plan. The UAE has quickly developed into a country that attracts the wealthy and investors. Options for obtaining a golden visa in the UAE include investing at least AED 2 million in a bank, investment fund, or property. However, the government can also nominate applicants for a golden visa. Residencies are typically valid for 10 years before they need to be renewed, and the UAE has been awarding citizenship to some of its biggest investors. We've worked with more than four investors who've made impressive investments in the economy, and the country has rewarded them with a UAE passport. Citizenship-by-investment in the UAE is not an official program that everyone can apply to, and that exclusivity is a draw for people. Our information is that less than a hundred passports have been awarded. Once you have a UAE passport, there are economic benefits. Expats are usually restricted to purchasing property in designated areas known as freehold areas. But with a UAE passport, these restrictions no longer apply. Among the Caribbean Islands, Antigua and Barbuda has attracted most of our clients this year. We feel that ultra-high-net-worth clients want a less popular program than one that everyone has, which is what's drawn people here. Antigua is also experiencing phenomenal economic growth and attracting brands and tourism. There's a focus on luxury hotel developments. Though it was completely devastated by hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017, it's becoming a playground for billionaires. The number of applicants for golden visas increases every year. I've witnessed ups and downs in the number of residence-by-investment programs available to wealthy migrants. Countries including Bulgaria, the UK, and Ireland have recently closed programs, so at the moment, I think more programs are closing than opening, but demand for these programs constantly grows. Programs are becoming more limited and more expensive, so I'd advise people who can afford to make these investments to do so now before processes become more difficult. Jump to"

OpenAI announced Wednesday it raised $6.6 billion in new funding at a $157 billion post-money valuation. Thrive Capital is leading the round, according to Bloomberg. Other investors in this round include Cathie Wood's ARK Venture Fund, Microsoft, Nvidia, Fidelity, and Altimeter.  The amount of Tiger's investment couldn't be learned but investors are required to put in a minimum of $250 million, The Information previously reported. Tiger Global, founded by Chase Coleman, invested at a furious pace during the tech boom, making 335 investments in 2021, according to Crunchbase. As the market soured, the firm has been much quieter, but it did purchase $125 million of OpenAI shares at the end of 2021. The closure of OpenAI's new funding round comes just a week after three of its top leaders suddenly resigned. Last week, former CTO Mira Murati, former Chief Research Officer Bob McGrew, and former VP of Research for Post Training Barret Zoph announced they were leaving the company. Reuters reported last week that OpenAI is currently working to transform its corporate structure to become a for-profit benefit corporation no longer under the control of the company's non-profit arm.

            "full_content": "At Apollo's presentation to investors on Tuesday, all eyes were on the firm's ambitious goal of doubling its assets under management and further cementing its place as the world's largest private lender. (Well, some eyes were on the firm's use of memes to diss its rivals). But buried in the discussion of origination, opening 401ks to private investments, and hybrid equity-replacement products were some unusual management tactics that CEO Marc Rowan said the firm was using to motivate its employees. \"We have woken the team up at 4:30 a.m. in the morning for meetings to prove to them that we need to do a wake-up call and something different,\" Rowan said. \"We've had outside speakers come in to scare the bejesus out of people. We've had cautionary tales.\" We, and presumably you, have a lot of questions. How do you wake people up at 4:30 a.m. without running into a wall of do-not-disturb messages? Which outside speakers did Apollo tap to scare the pants off its people? Are we talking Lehman Brothers scary? We contacted Apollo for more specifics, but the firm declined to comment. While the how is a mystery, Rowan was very clear about the why. The Apollo cofounder and CEO believes making money won't be as easy as it once was. \"We believe that assets are what is going to be scarce rather than capital,\" Rowan said, referring to an environment of more limited investment opportunities. (Business Insider covered this topic in a story explaining why portfolio-company execs are the new rising stars of private equity.) \"Change is coming,\" Rowan said. \"If we think we're going to succeed by doing more of the same, I think that's a fallacy, and we have to adapt, and we have to change.\" Before delving into Rowan's view of what Apollo needs to do to adjust to the new climate, we should note that the firm is using more than scare tactics to drive what Rowan described as a \"play to win\" work culture. On Tuesday, Rowan told investors that the firm had also put its own twist on the time-honored management tradition of a celebratory pizza party, replacing the pie with frozen yogurt. \"The single best decision I've made in the past 12 months was to personally buy a frozen-yogurt machine,\" Rowan said. \"We open the frozen-yogurt machine when we have a team win. It turns out people prefer frozen yogurt to money.\" Rowan, is of course, joking that people prefer froyo to money (and said as much). Apollo's professionals are particularly well-paid even in the private-equity industry. The point is that culture is a very serious business at Apollo. And Rowan spends half his time managing the firm's 200 leaders. \"How do we get the organization to play to win and not just to play not to lose probably consumes most of our management time,\" Rowan said. Today, Apollo manages close to $700 billion in assets, including a massive business underwriting loans. But on Tuesday, Rowan credited the firm's success since going public in 2008 to being \"lucky\" and just \"smart\" enough to be in the right place at the right time. This allowed it to reap the benefits of post-crisis low interest rates and its early investments in life insurance and retirement. Now, with interest rates high, the tailwinds are gone for Apollo and the industry as a whole, he said. Rowan said the key is to position the firm in front of the right tailwinds, just like it did to get where it is today. He identified four favorable market trends. The first is the need for massive infrastructure investment into renewable energy, utilities and power more broadly, and data centers. These are long and complicated projects that require creativity, Rowan said. \"These long-term solutions across a variety of cost of capital are not really appropriate for bank balance sheets who fund themselves short,\" Rowan said. \"They're not really appropriate for the plain vanilla of the investment grade marketplace. We, and institutional investors, are the long-dated capital necessary to do this.\" The second is the opportunity in retirement. There is $12 to $13 trillion in 401ks, but as of now, that capital is \"mostly\" invested into the S&P 500, which is largely weighted towards a few big companies. \"I jokingly say sometimes, 'We levered the entire retirement of America to Nvidia's performance,'\" Rowan said. \"It just doesn't seem smart.\" Rowan said he believed a change in presidential administration would open up private, illiquid investments to 401ks. Rowan also noted that individual investors, especially the more sophisticated \"family offices,\" would provide a tailwind and maybe some creative new ideas for the firm. Finally, he returned to a favorite theme, a reshaping of the private and public markets. \"What if it's not public is risky and private is safe?\" Rowan said. \"What if private is both safe and risky? And public is safe and risky? We think nothing of Nvidia going 20% to 30% in a day.\" Rowan said the firm's ability to use capital earmarked for the \"riskier\" alternatives bucket to create investment-grade debt was opening access to the larger and more conservative \"fixed income\" bucket of cash from institutional investors. He posited a \"hybrid\" future, also touting the firm's $60 to $70 billion Hybrid business, in which investors will own equity that is private (think private equity without the leverage). \"Active management may actually be both active management of buying and selling stocks, but active management may also be the active running of companies,\" Rowan said.

From classic eighties films like “Wall Street” to Bret Easton Ellis’s 1991 novel “American Psycho,” the world of finance has long provided a seductive backdrop for meditations on wealth and power. On this episode of Critics at Large, Vinson Cunningham, Naomi Fry, and Alexandra Schwartz discuss the many portrayals of this élite realm, and how its image has evolved over time. Where earlier texts glorified Wall Street types as roguish heroes, the Great Recession ushered in more critical fare, seeking to explain the inner workings of a system that benefitted the few at the expense of the many. In 2024, as TikTokers and personal essayists search for “a man in finance,” things seem to be shifting again. HBO’s “Industry,” now in its third season, depicts a cadre of young investment bankers clawing their way to the top of a soulless meritocracy—and may even engender some sympathy for the new finance bro. Why are audiences and creators alike so easily seduced by these stories, even after the disillusionment of the Occupy Wall Street era? “We’re talking about something—money—that is fun, and that we all on some level do want,” Cunningham says. “It’s always going to make us feel.” Read, watch, and listen with the critics: “Industry” (2020–)“Wall Street” (1987)“You don’t have to look for a ‘man in finance.’ He’s everywhere,” by Rachel Tashjian (The Washington Post)Joel Sternfeld’s “Summer Interns, Wall Street, New York”“American Psycho” (2000)“American Psycho,” by Bret Easton Ellis“Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps” (2010)“The Big Short” (2015)“The Wolf of Wall Street” (2013)“Margin Call” (2011)“The Case for Marrying an Older Man,” by Grazie Sophia Christie (The Cut)“My Year of Finance Boys,” by Daniel Lefferts (The Paris Review)“Ways and Means,” by Daniel Lefferts“Custom of the Country,” by Edith Wharton New episodes drop every Thursday.

            "full_content": "By  Umar Shakir, a news writer fond of the electric vehicle lifestyle and things that plug in via USB-C. He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.  Rivian is now shipping its electric trucks and SUVs with a tri-motor configuration, adding an extra power boost over the dual-motor version. The new 850 horsepower powertrain uses Rivian’s new in-house Enduro motors, with one in the front axle and two in the rear axle. The new tri-motor setup underpins Rivian’s newly redesigned Gen 2 models, which launched earlier this year in just a dual-motor configuration.  As reported by Inside EVs, these 2025 Rivian models are the first from the company to get a tri-motor setup, as the previous generation only came in dual and quad-motor setups. Rivian will start shipping its Gen 2 quad-motor version early next year. Between the front and rear motors sits Rivian’s new Max battery pack that’s capable of taking the vehicle up to 405 miles on a single charge in conserve mode or 371 miles for all-purpose driving. The R1T Ascend Tri-Max starts at $99,900. Tesla’s Cybertruck, the top-selling all-electric truck right now, also has dual and tri-motor options. However, the latter “Cyberbeast” model has a higher starting price of $113,990 compared to the Rivian. The EV market has a year-over-year uptick in sales, but electric trucks are still just a drop in the bucket against EV cars and SUVs. Rivian is adding more configurations in its quest to court more customers and sell more EVs. It needs cash flow to stay afloat in its lead-up to producing its lower-cost R2 SUV in 2026 and the stellar-looking R3 and R3X to follow. Rivian is getting some help from Volkswagen’s investment on that front.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "full_content": "Investing in China over the long term is nothing short of a bad idea, according to \"Big Short\" investor Kyle Bass. The Hayman Capital founder said he's still bearish on China, despite the historic run-up in Chinese stocks after Beijing unveiled a fresh stimulus package. That's because investing in China hasn't paid off for the last decade, he said, noting that Chinese stocks have only posted gains for five out of the last 20 years. The Hang Seng Index, which is made up of the largest Hong-Kong listed companies, climbed 16% in just five days after China's initial stimulus announcement. That brought the gauge to around the same level it was trading at 15 years ago, Bass noted, meaning investors who plowed cash into those stocks back then have barely made money. \"Typically, the biggest rallies are counter-trend rallies, and China's trend is just been down for so many years,\" Bass said in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday. \"Investing in communism has never worked in the long run.\" Investors avoiding Chinese stocks also don't have to worry about geopolitical tensions surrounding the country, such as possible conflict between Beijing and Taiwan, as well as the nation's growing partnership with other countries, like Russia, Bass said. \"Do I think that the rally could continue? Do I think that stocks could go up more? The answer's yes, but I equate it to picking up dimes in front of bulldozers,\" he said. Bass added: \"Could a communist government goose its market a little more, make it go up? Yes, absolutely. And if you're a trader, more power to you. If you invest in communism in the long run, you'll lose every time.\" Bass has been bearish on China for years, previously shorting the Chinese yuan before closing his position in 2019. In the past, he's told his Twitter followers it was time to \"completely cut ties\" with China's Communist party, and has called attention to the ongoing Uyghur genocide.

            "full_content": "With bonus season just a quarter away — big banks like Goldman and JPMorgan typically communicate the numbers in early January — Wall Street rainmakers may soon be thinking about what they want to spend this year's extra check on. And though investment bankers may not be quite as ostentatious as in the heyday of the '80s and '90s, there are still plenty of ways they choose to express their wealth and power. Business Insider spoke to four industry insiders who have eyes on what's trending at all levels of Wall Street, including a junior banker turned private-equity employee and a personal stylist who dresses managing directors and partners. To be sure, status symbols vary by seniority: what's impressive to junior bankers may be cringe to senior MDs, for example. That said, everyone seemed to agree that the days of logo-forward purchases and other conspicuous signs of wealth are over — even on Wall Street. The industry's movers and shakers are still into name brands but are leaning into those that exude \"quiet luxury.\" They are also spending money on personalization as well as experiences — think big trips, luxurious secondary homes, and posh sporting events. Here are 10 of the top status symbols on Wall Street in 2024. Attendance at exclusive sporting events like the Paris Olympics, the US Open, and Formula 1 races has become a surefire sign of status on Wall Street, insiders told BI. Indeed, Bloomberg declared the 2024 Paris Olympics \"Summer Davos\" for Wall Street in a story that reported sightings of CEOs Ken Griffin of Citadel, David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, and Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone, to name just a few. Last month, the US Open in Queens took the spotlight online as the hottest place for New York socialites to see and be seen. And where there are celebrities and influencers, there tend to be Wall Street dealmakers. \"All my clients went to the US Open,\" said Jessica Cadmus, a personal stylist whose clients are almost exclusively managing directors and partners at finance firms in New York. Even junior-level employees said the famous tennis tournament was the place to be to mark the end of summer. \"I know at least three people in the finance community who were at the Open last night,\" a young private-equity employee told BI in August after attending the tournament with friends. Of course, the most elevated version of this status symbol is owning your own sports team — or getting access to private box seats. Wall Street executives have no shortage of personal assistants and staff, said Cadmus, because every moment of their time is worth thousands of dollars. \"Everybody that I work with has at least one person, if not multiple people, in their home all day long attending to X, Y, or Z,\" Cadmus told BI. \"There are assemblies of nannies, home cleaners, and chefs.\" Lately, there has been a new trendy addition to the usual in-home lineup — that of the \"home organizer.\" Think Marie Kondo — someone who comes into your home, takes a good look around, and crafts a custom organization plan to make your space user-friendly and effortlessly neat. \"I would say over the last five years, I've seen people leaning into that sort of service more, and I'd never really seen a ton of that,\" Cadmus said. This person might, for example, put custom inserts for your kitchen cabinets so your Le Creuset pots fit seamlessly. But an organizer tackles just about any space you could conjure up, from a pantry to the coat closet or your kid's playroom. \"People do want to feel more connected to the items in their home, and they do want to feel a sense that things need to have a purpose and they need to be organized,\" Cadmus said. A PR expert who works in the industry said they have seen a trend in one particular shoe recently among very high-ranking execs in the office: Zegna's \"triple stitch\" sneakers. The leather version (pictured below) costs about $1,300 per pair and come in a ton of colors. An espadrille version of the shoe was also a hot summer pick, this person said, and costs about $1,100. Cadmus likes Zegna for men's off-the-rack suits, but for office-friendly sneakers she recommends the Tom Ford nylon and suede sneakers in black and white, which she described as \"heavy lifters\" for her clients. Cadmus has seen a notable uptick in senior bankers going on extravagant and foreign getaways. \"I feel like the shift, especially with the younger, up-and-coming rising stars is not stuff — it's experiences, it's travel,\" said Cadmus. This is leading to more safari adventures in Africa and, this past summer in particular, family vacations to Costa Rica. To be clear, we're not talking about an all-inclusive Sandals resort situation here. They're highly bespoke, private, and personal trips. \"Whether it be a Four Seasons or whether it be a super fancy boutique hotel, every bit of the travel is going to be a first-class situation.\" For example, you might have a personal tour guide to take you on adventure experiences away from the throngs of tourists, a chef to cook your family private dinners each night, as well as a personal driver. And when one person at a firm loves a place or experience, it tends to spread like wildfire in popularity. \"The culture is so strong and the word of mouth is so strong that if one thing or experience is vetted by someone and recommended, that recommendation is golden because everybody has the same sort of expectations,\" said Cadmus. \"Things really get passed from person to person. It's a pretty tight community that way, especially in the bigger banks.\" Van Cleef is a high-end jewelry brand, and one type of necklace in particular has taken over the necks of Wall Street women (and the wives of male rainmakers): the Alhambra. It has an unmistakable nickel-sized pendant in the shape of a four-leaf clover, comes in various colors, and, depending on the model, costs about $3,000. \"I distinctly remember that my first day of banking training there were three or four girls with them on their necks, and I was like, what is that necklace?\" said the private-equity junior. This person, along with the other insiders who spoke to BI for this story, laughed at the mention of the brand because it has become so ubiquitous. But cliché or not, they agreed the brand has an undeniable presence in investment banking. \"I think they're sort of perpetual,\" added Cadmus. \"And beyond Wall Street too. It's just kind of a favored wealthy person brand.\" Another popular piece for Wall Street women is the Cartier \"love\" bracelet — a bangle with the brand's iconic circular screws that sells for $7,350. Cadmus loves Cartier as a choice for fine jewelry staples, but for her clients, she often opts for the slightly less popular \"Juste un Clou\" line. \"The Love bracelet has been 'the one' for a while now,\" she said. There's another option for those who want more unique pieces: handcrafted jewelry. Cadmus said she has seen an uptick in clients who prefer to have their jewelry customized. \"A lot of my clients have a jeweler with who we discuss what will be made for them,\" said Cadmus. \"We'll see something, and a lot of times we will riff on that and be like, 'oh, that's cool, but it'd be better with this stone' or, 'I like that necklace, but I would prefer it as a bracelet.' Then we talk to the jeweler, and we have it made.\" Depending on the materials you choose, she said, you can often have items made for 30% to 40% less than designer prices. \"Quiet luxury\" is the new protocol for looking chic on Wall Street versus the ostentatious brand flexing of the past. The term refers to wearing pieces that are very high-quality and expensive but don't sport conspicuous logos and aren't necessarily made by household luxury names. \"The bonuses aren't as outsized as they used to be, and when they are, that's not something your institution really wants you to advertise in any way,\" Cadmus said. \"So there is this quiet rule, and especially with the big MDs, which is just don't be ostentatious about your wealth. It's very frowned upon.\" The private-equity junior agreed. \"No guy walks around with a Hermes or Gucci belt,\" this person said. Pop culture phenomena, like the popular HBO TV series \"Succession,\" have put the quiet luxury trend in the spotlight. Leading actor Jeremy Strong wore a coat from the brand Loro Piana (pictured below) in an episode of the show. \"Loro Piana is probably the preeminent quiet luxury brand,\" Cadmus said of the label, which she has used for years. Other quiet luxury brands Cadmus reaches for when styling clients include Armani and Tom Ford for men and Akris and Max Mara for women. For quiet luxury bags and accessories, Cadmus recommends brands like Hermès, Celine, Bottega Veneta, and Khaite. Cadmus has also observed an uptick in clients going all out to make their homes truly their own. \"Most of my clients have apartments that were originally two or three separate apartments that they had renovated to become one,\" said Cadmus. The same goes for their other properties. It's not surprising that high-earners on Wall Street would have second homes (or, in many cases, multiple). But it's not just buying a great place that's a status symbol — it's having a whole team behind every facet of its construction and design, said Cadmus. That means, for example, hiring a renowned architect for the project and a best-in-class interior designer to outfit the home with luxurious furnishings. \"It's a major production. It's not like, 'Okay, we're just going to snatch this thing up and live in it as is.' It is a major overhaul.\" The beach towns of the Hamptons have long been a Wall Street favorite thanks to their proximity to Manhattan. They remain a popular spot for summer trips and second homes, Cadmus said. Even juniors tend to rent out homes in Montauk and split the cost to get in on the fun, said a former banking analyst who recently quit. Indeed, in the summer, the train from Manhattan to Montauk is \"full of finance people on their phone arguing about a deal and legal docs and clacking on their laptops,\" added the private-equity junior. Nantucket and Cape Cod, according to Cadmus, are also popular but less cliche choices for second-home locations. For young Wall Streeters, having an Equinox membership is par for the course, said the two ex-investment banking analysts. Equinox is a \"luxury\" gym that has \"innovative group fitness classes, luxurious spas, and exclusive boutiques,\" as described on its website. A membership costs hundreds of dollars a month, varying by perks package and location access. The top-tier membership is $500 a month plus a $750 initiation fee. There are about 30 Equinox gyms in Manhattan, but \"having access to the Equinox Hudson Yards location is a status symbol,\" said the former analyst who recently quit. As BI reported in 2019, the Hudson Yards location has — among other amenities — views of the Hudson River in nearly every part of the gym, both indoor and outdoor pools, and is complete with its own cafe and bar. To be sure, this is a status symbol unique to younger people. Senior bankers don't want to be part of a gym scene, Cadmus said. Among their aforementioned lineup of domestic staff is usually a personal trainer who comes to their in-home gym. \"Yes, a younger person is going to enjoy that — there are social perks to that. But senior people do not want to be looked at when they're working out,\" she said. \"They want somebody tracking it for them — their progression and all that kind of stuff. It's just totally different.\" Jump to"

            "full_content": "Melissa Goldman will soon have oversight of the technology powering one of the highest-profile businesses on Wall Street. As the incoming global head of technology engineering for Goldman Sachs' global banking and markets division, the ex-Googler will run the engineering team for Goldman's investment banking and sales and trading units. \"There is just a ton of stuff to do, so they tell me. And lots of different challenges in the space given how much is being invested in this particular business,\" Goldman told Business Insider, referring to efforts to build systems that can handle the firm's anticipated growth in a compliant and resilient way. Goldman Sachs' core business of advising companies through mergers, acquisitions, and raising capital, has come under the spotlight recently as investment-banking activity continues to be slow. It's perhaps more important than ever for technology, through things like automation and artificial intelligence, to play \"a significant role in lowering the cost of individual transactions,\" Goldman said. Automating tasks could also help cut down junior bankers' hours. With an anticipated decline in trading volumes across Wall Street, Goldman's sales and trading business will continue to lean on technology to win market share among institutional investors. On Oct. 7, Goldman will return to the bank where she began her career 30 years ago as an analyst. During her first stint at Goldman, she managed various tech teams and was named managing director in 2008. More recently, she's worked as the vice president of corporate engineering at Google and as the chief information officer of corporate technology at JPMorgan, where she was also chief data officer. Though Goldman will be stepping into one of the biggest technology roles at the bank, she said one of her most important jobs out of the gate will be to listen. \"I'm inheriting this very robust portfolio and I think it's important to make sure that people feel supported in the work that's been happening,\" Goldman said. Videocalling in from Bermuda, where Goldman is on vacation before returning to Wall Street, the tech exec opens up about how she will bring some of what she's learned at Google to Goldman, and the routine that lets her stay at the top of her game. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Is there anything that you picked up from your time in Big Tech, or at Google specifically, that you're looking to incorporate at Goldman? Google has a very unique and special culture, which I enjoyed for close to three years. That experience shaped me in all kinds of ways, and I'm going to bring those experiences forward. The focus on the employee is exceptional in that organization. There are just a lot of different kinds of projects that evolve and change over time and there's a lot of investment in areas where you have to fail sometimes to innovate at pace and at scale. I mean, there are certain characteristics around accommodating individuals. They have a work-from-anywhere program where you have more flexibility in certain physical places where you can work. Those are just different kinds of things that are done to address, I think, some of the sentiments of the employees and try to create a different kind of accommodation in that context. There's a lot of talk of a softer third quarter in terms of trading volume, IPO activity, and M&A. How are you thinking about technology to help buoy the banking and markets business? At the end of the day, technology plays a significant role in lowering the cost of individual transactions. I consider the responsibility that I have to the business to optimize, to create valuable insights that otherwise, decisions couldn't be as precise and meticulous. Therefore, creating more of that opportunity to be able to wow and impress our clients with capabilities that they otherwise wouldn't have accessible and available. These are all the kinds of things that I think the sort of technology portfolio can add. This ends up being a team conversation with our business and really making sure that we're putting investments against the things that we're going to realize value. But you could imagine thinking about all of the manual processes and all of the research that goes into the banking function, and how much access and availability there is to be able to get knowledge into processes in ways that are much more efficient through leverage of LLMs and such. That being said, precision around data and making sure that there are no hallucinations, becomes something that's absolutely essential to this business, and so trying to investigate and figure out some of these things. I have to admit, there might be a whole set of work already in progress, and so I don't want to misstep here, but from the outside, these are the kinds of things that I could imagine would be ripe opportunities that would benefit the business. There's a lot of talk about junior bankers' hours, especially with the recent JPMorgan and Bank of America announcements about implementing guardrails to protect younger bankers from burnout. How are you thinking about technology and maybe being able to automate some of those mundane, repeatable tasks that junior bankers do sometimes? Well, my daughter's dating a junior banker at another company, and I'm watching. She's two years in, and I'm watching the activities that she's involved in. And yeah, I mean, you look at some of it and you think, 'Wow, being able to automate some of these tasks and pull information together in a reliable and meaningful way. These are some of the areas.' I'm really looking forward to seeing where Goldman is on that journey and then figuring out how I could be more impactful in helping with that. You've had a very impressive career jumping between some of the biggest names in tech and finance. What habits or hacks or routines help keep you at the top of your game? I love my cardio because it puts me in a space where I can sort of clear my head and think not so much about transactional things but a little bit more about strategic things. It allows space and time for that while I'm actually doing something healthy for me. And so that's something that I have really maintained a big part of, just my work-life balance. I used to run a lot, and as I get older, I've learned that I've actually got to mix it up a little bit more. So I mostly alternate between running and cycling. I'll go back and forth, but virtually six or seven days a week, I'll have some form of cardio daily so that I get that time to just regenerate and put things into their right places so that I can tackle the days. When you get back from Bermuda, when do you start? I start on October 7th, and so I'll be winding down at Google Friday. I'll have two weeks to probably address my wardrobe because again, I am going back from t-shirts and jeans to now a little bit more of a formal, not too formal, but nonetheless banking culture. So I have to go try on a bunch of clothes and make sure I do a little bit of shopping before I start.  Jump to"

            "full_content": "Go big or go home. The Federal Reserve didn't hold back when it cut interest rates for the first time in more than four years. The central bank announced a jumbo cut of 50 basis points, ending its ongoing battle against post-pandemic inflation and giving investors exactly what they wanted. While the cut was never in question, its size was widely debated heading into Wednesday's announcement. The speculation was that opting for the larger cut might indicate the Fed is worried about the economy. (The worse things are, the more relief is needed, the thinking goes.) Fed Chair Jerome Powell threw cold water on those concerns. In a press conference after the announcement, Powell said he believes the economy is moving in the right direction. But don't get used to jumbo cuts, as Powell said Wednesday's 50-point reduction doesn't guarantee the central bank will maintain that pace going forward. So what does this rate cut mean for … everything? First off, don't expect any immediate changes. It'll take a while before the effects of the cut reach the rest of us. But that doesn't mean you can't plan ahead. Our colleagues at Personal Finance Insider have covered the eventual impacts the rate cut will have on various financial products. Let's start with mortgage rates, since that's an area people naturally think of when it comes to interest rates. Bad news, prospective homebuyers: Don't expect mortgage rates to drop much in response to the Fed's announcement, as the market has already priced in the reduction. And if you're locked into a high mortgage rate, maybe hold off on refinancing until a few more cuts materialize. Another key consideration is where to park your cash. The cut means the rates banks offer for their savings accounts will likely go down eventually. As a result, you might want to consider investing some of the cash you may have sitting on the sidelines in high-yield savings and money market accounts. But experts emphasized it's important not to panic regarding your investments. Instead, use the new rate as a chance to reevaluate your investment strategy. That could include further diversifying your investments or even diving back into bonds. The rate reduction also won't be enough to significantly lower high-interest credit card debt. Instead, you'll still have to do it the hard way: Consolidating debt and prioritizing just paying it off. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

            "full_content": "Twenty years ago, inside a humble one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco's South of Market neighborhood, Kamala Harris might've one day dreamed of running for president. Last week, a group of Harris supporters gathered in the same apartment — now an Airbnb rental — to watch her first debate as the Democratic nominee, according to a report from The New York Times. Before she was in the national spotlight, Harris purchased the one-bedroom condo for $489,000 in 2004, according to an old Zillow listing. Harris served as the city's district attorney from 2004 until 2011. She was attorney general of California, then a senator. She sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, but dropped out. Joe Biden tapped her to be his running mate later that year. In 2021, software engineer Zhengtao Ji, who goes by David, paid for $860,000 for the apartment to use as an investment property, but he wasn't told until late in the process that Harris was the seller, according to the Times. Ji has listed the apartment on Airbnb with a minimum of 30-night stays and advertises the \"amazing opportunity to live inside the home previously owned by Vice President Kamala Harris.\" He's even added a commemorative wall with photos from her career, including the day she was sworn in as vice president, according to the listing. The short-term rental runs around $6,000 for a minimum 30-night stay and is currently available for the month of October, according to the Airbnb listing. The home is largely undecorated, with plain beige walls and simple blue-and-white furniture. The outdoor patio space is only big enough for a table with one chair. That hasn't stopped at least one Harris supporter from booking it. The Times reported that venture capitalist Lata Setty booked the former Harris residence this past month, using the space as an informal hub to support the campaign. Setty served South Indian dishes to guests as they watched Harris debate former President Donald Trump, the Times said. Setty, a former lawyer and intellectual property officer, is the founder of the How Women Invest funds I & II, which puts money into the financial services, energy, and information technology sectors, according to Pitchbook. The Times reported that Setty called Harris a \"rock star\" when talking with other supporters at the debate party. Harris has owned homes on both coasts, including a one in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles and a condo in downtown Washington, DC. She currently lives in the vice president's official residence: the Naval Observatory in DC. Axel Springer, Insider Inc.'s parent company, is an investor in Airbnb. Jump to"

The US economy grew by 3% in the second quarter, and the stock market hit all-time highs in the third quarter, averting fears of a recession at hand. While the economy has remained resilient for the better part of the year, the US Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point rate cut surprised many analysts. Jamie Dimon believes the steep cut might be justified as geopolitical uncertainties can potentially disrupt the gains achieved by affecting supply chains and triggering uncertainties and fears in the market. READ ALSO: Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: 8 Top Stock Picks and 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at 52-Week Lows. Powell and other Fed officials are open to further lowering interest rates after last month’s half-point cut, but there’s market debate on the pace. Soaring tensions in the Middle East with Israel invading Lebanon and threatening to attack Iran have triggered a layer of uncertainty, which Dimon believes could have a significant impact on the economy. Consequently, the banker believes that the 50 basis point cut could offer the much-needed economic support as inflation continues to drop. Nevertheless, James Demerit, Main Street Research CIO, believes the upward momentum in the equity markets will persist as the macro environment improves. While valuations appear to have gotten out of hand, there are still opportunities for stocks trading below their fair value as the investment environment improves. Apart from the magnificent seven stocks whose valuations have gotten out of hand, other stocks are trading at 16 times earnings, which, according to Demmert, is cheap considering the strong fundamentals that support a further rally. Companies that have consistently grown sales and profits should continue delivering regardless of the uncertainties around the US election and soaring geopolitical tensions. According to Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO of Bowersock Capital Partners, it is time to be upbeat about the market heading into year-end. “The bull market has survived the year’s historically weakest quarter,” said Hill in an interview with CNBC. “It is likely to remain intact through at least the end of the year, as earnings remain strong, interest rates are moving lower and consumers are still spending.” When considering which stocks to buy, it’s beneficial to ask, “Which industries are experiencing the most rapid growth?” Despite some sectors facing challenges post-pandemic, many are flourishing, offering abundant opportunities. The global economy is rapidly evolving, with industries like artificial intelligence (AI), healthcare, travel, online retail, cybersecurity, and green energy experiencing significant growth. The AI market alone is projected to reach $407 billion by 2027 (according to estimates from Markets and Markets). The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that between 2020 and 2030, total employment in the United States will expand by 11.9 million, or 7.7%, to 165.4 million from 153.5 million. Some of the top stocks that will make you rich in 5 to 10 years are companies that can rally as the global economy grows on the back of favorable monetary policies. Additionally, they include stocks of companies that are leaders in their respective fields and well-poised to benefit from technological changes such as artificial intelligence. In an interview with CNBC, Savita Subramanian, BofA Securities head, reiterated utilities and large-cap real estate stocks are well positioned to perform heading into year end. Likewise, industrials and financials should receive a significant boost if the overall economy improves. According to Subramanian, the idea of the Fed cutting is not only liquidity inducing that should benefit the equity market but a move that ends up cutting money market yields. With liquidity slowly moving out of short-term bonds, most of it is ending up in equity markets as investors take note of high-risk reward opportunities at highly discounted valuations. Subramanian believes dividend stocks and growth stocks are well-positioned to generate significant value going forward. With this economic perspective in mind, let’s start our list of stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. Pixabay/Public Domain Our Methodology To compile the list of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, we sifted through multiple reports and rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 possible stocks that experts and analysts believe have multi-year growth opportunities. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds and ranked them in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that held stakes in them, as of the end of Q2 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 279 Amid the artificial intelligence race, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is arguably one of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, given the investments it’s made around the emerging technology. The company is also leveraging the technology to strengthen its cloud computing solution under Azure. Azure is the source of the largest AI opportunity from all this. With a current % market share of 25%, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the second-largest provider of cloud computing services after Amazon, and its new AI tools are helping it grow even further. During the Q4 earnings call, the management reported that Azure now has 60,000 AI customers, which is approximately 60% more than it had during the same quarter last year. Given that Goldman Sachs projects that the cloud computing industry will generate $2 trillion in sales by 2030, Microsoft should be one of the beneficiaries, allowing it to generate more shareholder value. AI is already driving some of that growth, and Microsoft stands to gain as more businesses turn to its AI cloud services to improve their own AI offerings. Additionally, it has turned to technology to strengthen and enhance user experience on its office solutions, including Microsoft Office. Its investment of close to $13 billion in ChatGPT parent OpenAI has also had a hand in strengthening its search tool Bing sits to take on Google. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) regularly reports strong financial results; the most recent quarter was no exception. Its operating income and revenue grew by 15% annually, which is remarkable for a business of this size. Earnings per share (EPS) exceeded analysts’ estimates, landing at $2.95. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s ability to boost profitability while growing steadily is demonstrated by the growth of its earnings per share, affirming its ability to make shareholders rich. Over the previous five years, its outstanding share count has only dropped by about 3%, so a large portion of the growth can be linked to its improved earnings. Amid the earnings growth, Microsoft continues to reward investors with a 0.80% dividend yield even as it trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 31. In the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and their stakes amounted to $89.07 billion. Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft’s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft’s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI – its suite of AI services – is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot – its AI code writing service – is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio – its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.” Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

            "full_content": "As we move from ambition to action on climate, realities are starting to hit.  Many companies that have set climate targets are struggling to meet them—particularly when it comes to their scope 3 supply chain emissions. We need to rapidly limit deforestation—but we need new forms of finance to do so. And we must significantly expand the flows of finance for climate action to the Global South. These are not easy tasks and solving these problems will require us to get practical and use every tool we have. Now is the time to step up and deliver. The voluntary carbon market can play a critical role. It can provide finance for a wide range of emissions reduction and removal projects in the places that need it most, and a way for businesses to be more ambitious, and go beyond their all important decarbonization efforts.  But the market today isn’t where we need it to be. We don’t just need a market that’s three times bigger, or even five times bigger—it has to be a whole order of magnitude larger to deliver the climate impact we need it to. But such scaling requires transformation. The voluntary market has been held back by legitimate concerns about whether projects that generate credits really deliver emissions reductions and removals, whether businesses that buy credits can do so without delaying decarbonization, and without fear of double counting emissions reductions or removals. There have also been questions over whether it is built to scale, and what needs to be done to ensure the robust guardrails and infrastructure of other financial markets.  Building confidence across the market is fundamental to growing its impact and to boosting flows of carbon finance to the Global South. For this to be a truly global market that brings a range of benefits alongside emissions reductions and removals, all stakeholders need to be involved, and Indigenous peoples and local communities must be front and center of its development. The good news is we now have solutions to these problems. These are the basis of the transformation that we need to see.  Read more: How Carbon Markets Can Deliver to the Front Lines of the Climate Crisis In July 2023, the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market launched the first independent global quality standard to define a “high-quality credit”: the Core Carbon Principles (CCPs). Credits that meet the standard’s criteria can be identified by buyers as they are tagged with a “CCP” label by the independent carbon crediting programs that issue them. The CCP label ensures each credit generated by a project is equal to one metric tonne of emissions reduced or removed, and supports sustainable development and biodiversity. The first carbon credits with the CCP label, backed by these strict assessment criteria, are now reaching the market.  Complementing the Integrity Council’s work on the supply side of the market, the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMI) has worked on codes of conduct for companies using carbon credits, to ensure credibility of their action. The Claims Code, launched in June 2023, encourages companies to be more ambitious, giving them clear guardrails, including types and quantities of credits they should purchase and how to talk about them, to ensure they’re using credits in the right way, and going beyond their internal decarbonization targets. In addition, a new scope 3 claim which is currently in public consultation will enable businesses that are not on track to reduce emissions in their value chain to continue financing climate action by using carbon credits for a limited time.  Meanwhile, the Global Carbon Markets Utility (GCMU) is building the infrastructure needed for the market to operate like a mature financial market with more transparency and accountability. The GCMU is working to increase standardization to facilitate accurate credit pricing and to introduce robust data standards, digitization, and the necessary mechanisms to enforce these standards. This new infrastructure will encourage the financial community to make a substantial commitment to expanding the market.  But these organizations can’t do it alone. We need to collectively move further, faster—and chart a path forward across supply, demand, and within the market to scale high-integrity carbon credits that deliver on their potential. We’re now at an inflection point. A wide range of governments—from the U.S., U.K., and Singapore to Kenya—have recognised the importance of the voluntary markets. And incoming regulatory developments around the world demonstrate that step-by-step, important foundations are being put in place to build confidence.  But if the market is to succeed, policy makers and regulators must also step up and signal their support and the private sector must invest. We need a harmonized and consistent approach, including alignment with the CCPs as the standard for quality to support a global voluntary market. Doing so will provide a signal to corporations that they can invest with confidence in the market as a complement to rapid decarbonisation of their operations, and make high integrity claims about their action. To build a sense of momentum and scale the market, we need more forward-thinking companies to lead the way. And we need financial actors to continue developing the infrastructure to grow and anticipate the regulatory scrutiny the market would come under at scale.  Between us, we have developed a clear code of claims for companies on how and when they should use credits. We are reviewing and approving types of projects that can be labeled as high integrity and the volume of CCP labeled credits will grow. And we are building the infrastructure to support a transparent, efficient market that’s primed for growth. The foundation is being laid for countries and companies to participate in a high-integrity voluntary carbon market. We need to take action, together, at pace. Every day, every minute, every tonne—counts. Amy Merrill is the CEO of the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market, an independent global governance body for the carbon market. Mark Kenber is the executive director of the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative, a non-profit that works across stakeholders to support the carbon market.

This mesh Wi-Fi system was originally priced at $169 and it is now available for just $38, which makes it an absolute steal for anyone looking to upgrade their home network. This deal is accessible to all shoppers, not just Prime members. See At Amazon The timing of this clearance sale is particularly significant as Google has officially discontinued the Nest Wifi earlier this year in favor of the more expensive Nest Wifi Pro ($199). This means that this could be one of the last chances to acquire this highly regarded router before it disappears from the market entirely. At this price point, it’s not just a good deal – it’s an act of sheer madness to pass it up. It is part of our our top 10 products for this post Prime Day Saturday. Despite being succeeded by a newer model, the original Google Nest Wifi remains an excellent choice for most households. It offers impressive coverage of up to 2,200 square feet and can handle connections for up to 200 devices simultaneously. While it may not boast the latest Wi-Fi 6 technology like the Pro version, its Wi-Fi 5 capabilities are more than sufficient for everyday tasks like streaming 4K videos, online gaming and managing smart home devices. One of the much appreciated features of this router is its user-friendly setup and management through the Google Home app. Users can easily monitor their network, create guest networks and implement parental controls with just a few taps. This simplicity combined with its seamless integration with other Google products makes it a great option for those already invested in the Google ecosystem. As a discontinued product, once the current stock is depleted, it’s highly unlikely that we’ll see the Nest Wifi available again, let alone at such a drastically reduced price. This makes the current offer not just a good deal but potentially a last-chance opportunity to own a piece of Google’s networking technology at a fraction of its original cost. Also, while newer models like the Nest Wifi Pro offer more advanced features, the original Nest Wifi still holds its own in terms of performance for most household needs. Many users find that Wi-Fi 5 is more than adequate for their daily internet activities and this clearance deal is even more attractive for them.

            "full_content": "Financial markets in China are waiting for Beijing to finally provide fiscal stimulus at a scheduled announcement on Saturday, the key ingredient missing in its latest push to shore up China's economy. Finance Minister Lan Fo'an is set to announce a fresh consumer-focused boost this weekend — or at least that's what investors hope will happen. According to a Bloomberg survey, most analysts expect authorities to pledge $283 billion of fiscal stimulus at Saturday's highly anticipated press conference. Expected measures could include consumption vouchers, improved social safety nets, and subsidies on specific products. Analysts have long agreed that China's stubbornly low domestic demand is the crux of the country's economic problems, and many were disappointed to see measures in Beijing's latest stimulus package fail to address the issue.  Some commentators suggest this is partly due to the leadership's ideology, which seems to disapprove of welfare and direct consumer aid. In its latest stimulus package unveiled in late September, the country instead delivered interest rate cuts, a lower reserve ratio requirement for banks, a stock stabilization fund, and mortgage support in the housing sector. The September 24 announcement surprised global investors, sending Chinese stocks on a roller coaster rally. The CSI 300 Index roared up 27%, investors saw the efforts as an inflection point in the country's recovery and expected more to come. However, momentum fizzled this week after Beijing failed to meet the market's expectations. Though China's National Development and Reform Commission announced further support policies on Tuesday, investors were disappointed by the lack of another major boost. The CSI 300 index fell over 7% the next day. Chinese authorities followed up by announcing Saturday's press conference, which promised to introduce new measures centered on fiscal policy. It remains to be seen how far Beijing actually goes in bolstering consumers. Some analysts remain less sure about what fiscal stimulus will actually achieve on its own, pointing out that Beijing needs to pursue structural reforms to revive consumer confidence. \"Fiscal policy could have a role to play in tackling some of the structural imbalances, but this would be as part of a long-term re-orientation of government priorities, not a one-off package,\" wrote Mark Williams, Capital Economics Chief Asia Economist. For instance, that could take the form of improved healthcare and retirement policies that encourage Chinese consumers to save less, Yale economist Stephen Roach previously wrote. Meanwhile, one expert suggested that investors are misunderstanding China's intent in providing the stimulus boosts. According to Arthur Kroeber, founding partner of Gavekal Dragonomics, Beijing's intent isn't to accelerate the economy by enabling consumers, but simply to stabilize it. \"The economic aims are to stabilize growth and prevent deflation from tightening its grip,\" he wrote in the Financial Times. \"The market goal is to restore enough confidence so that equity prices post steady, moderate rises. This will reopen the window for new listings and enable the stock market to resume its assigned role of financing China's industrial policy ambitions.\" Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks Jump to"

This masive discount makes it one of the hottest deals of the first day of Prime Day and it’s likely to disappear faster than you can say “crispy fries.” See at Amazon The Ninja Air Fryer isn’t just another kitchen gadget; it’s a game-changer for home cooks looking to prepare healthier meals without sacrificing flavor. With its innovative DualZone Technology, this air fryer boasts two independent 5-quart baskets, allowing you to cook two different foods simultaneously. This feature alone sets it apart from traditional single-basket air fryers, eliminating the need for back-to-back cooking sessions. One of the popular features of this Ninja XL Air Fryer is its Smart Finish and Match Cook capabilities. The Smart Finish feature lets you cook two different foods using two different methods so that they finish at the same time. Meanwhile, the Match Cook feature allows you to easily copy settings across both zones for when you’re cooking larger portions of the same dish. For those big family meals or when you’re entertaining guests, the XL 10-quart capacity comes in handy. You can whip up a main course and a side dish simultaneously or cook up to 8 pounds of chicken wings with ease. The air fryer’s versatility shines through its 6-in-1 functionality and offers programs for Air Fry, Air Broil, Roast, Keep Warm, Dehydrate and Bake. Health-conscious cooks will appreciate that this Ninja Air Fryer uses up to 75% less fat than traditional deep-frying methods without compromising on that crispy texture we all crave. The wide temperature range of 105°F to 450°F ensures you can tackle a variety of recipes, from delicate dehydrated fruits to perfectly roasted meats. At $159 instead of $209, this Ninja Air Fryer represents exceptional value for money. It’s not just an air fryer; it’s a multi-functional cooking appliance that can replace several kitchen gadgets, saving you both space and money in the long run. However, as with all Prime Day deals, especially on popular items like this, the offer is likely to be short-lived. The combination of the Ninja brand’s reputation for quality, the air fryer’s versatile features, and the significant price drop is sure to make this a fast-selling item.

            "full_content": "\nThis article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.\n      We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site.\n     Today is the first day of Prime Day at Amazon, and you can enjoy a stunning deal on LG’s OLED evo C4 Series 4K TVs. The current deal offers a massive discount across multiple screen sizes and what’s exciting is that it’s accessible to all customers, not just Prime members. With this level of accessibility, these TVs are likely to sell out at lightning speed, so quick make sure you snag this deal before it runs out of stock. The star of the Prime Day show is undoubtedly the 65-inch LG C4 OLED TV which is now priced at a jaw-dropping $1,496 down from its original $2,699. This whopping $1,200 discount is a massive 45% discount and makes it one of the most compelling offers of this Prime Day event. But the deals don’t stop there – the entire C4 series lineup is seeing significant price cuts. See 65″ LG TV at Amazon See 65″ LG TV at Amazon These prices rival and in some cases surpass the best deals typically seen during Black Friday and offer consumers a rare opportunity to make substantial savings on top-tier TV technology. Remember LG is one of the best players for OLED technology and this C4 model features over 8 million self-lit pixels that deliver an unparalleled viewing experience. For gaming enthusiasts, the C4 series is nothing else than a dream come true. This LG OLED TV boasts a 144Hz refresh rate and a lightning-fast 0.1ms response time that guarantees ultra-smooth gameplay free from screen tearing and stuttering. The inclusion of the powerful NVIDIA G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium compatibility ensures that gamers can enjoy their favorite titles without interruptions. With four HDMI 2.1 inputs available, connecting multiple gaming consoles is a breeze. The audio capabilities of the C4 series are equally impressive: support for Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos brings a cinematic sound experience right into your living room. The Filmmaker Mode is another standout feature from this LG OLED TV available at Prime Day and allows users to watch films exactly as directors intended by preserving original aspect ratios, colors and frame rates. Given the current massive discounts and the impressive feature set of the C4 series, this Prime Day deal is probably the best value propositions in the TV market today. Whether you’re a movie enthusiast looking for stunning visuals, a serious gamer or simply in the market for a premium TV to elevate your home entertainment system, the LG OLED evo C4 Series (at this price) is a no-brainer. It’s worth noting that deals of this magnitude on such high-quality TVs are rare outside of major shopping events. With prices matching or beating typical Black Friday offers, this Prime Day is a great chance to upgrade your viewing experience without waiting for the holiday season. However, as with all Prime Day deals, especially those open to all shoppers, stock is likely to deplete rapidly. The combination of record-low prices, top-tier technology and universal accessibility means these TVs could sell out in record time.

            "full_content": "\nThis article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.\n      We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site.\n     Amazon did not sell out of all the AirPods Pro 2 during Prime Day; instead, it is running a massive promotion this weekend. The popular wireless earbuds, originally priced at $24, are now available for just $189. This massive discount comes just days after the Prime Day event and makes it an excellent opportunity for those who missed out earlier. See at Amazon This price drop is particularly noteworthy because it is now accessible to everyone, not just Prime members. Such a deal on Apple products is rare especially for a recent model like the AirPods Pro 2. The earbuds have garnered attention for their impressive features and sound quality, making them a desirable accessory for Apple enthusiasts. The AirPods Pro 2 are powered by the advanced Apple H2 chip which enhances audio performance across the board. This chip allows for richer bass and clearer treble and elevate the listening experience to new heights. One of the very much appreciated features of these earbuds is their Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) which has been improved compared to previous models. This technology effectively blocks out ambient noise and allows users to immerse themselves fully in their music or podcasts. Comfort is another key aspect of the AirPods Pro 2 design. They come with four sizes of silicone ear tips so that there’s a snug fit for various ear shapes. This customizable fit not only enhances comfort but also optimizes the noise-canceling capabilities of the earbuds. Additionally, they feature touch controls for easy volume adjustments and playback control. The Personalized Spatial Audio feature is another highlight (which is quite unique to Apple) and provides an immersive sound experience that adapts to the unique shape of each user’s ears. This technology creates a three-dimensional audio environment that enhances the overall listening experience, making it feel as though sound is coming from all around you. Battery life has also seen improvements in this model. Users can enjoy up to 6 hours of listening time with ANC enabled and up to 30 hours when using the charging case. This extended battery life makes the AirPods Pro 2 an excellent choice for long commutes, travel, or extended listening sessions without needing to recharge frequently. At $189 instead of $249, the AirPods Pro 2 now compete with mid-range wireless earbuds while offering (way) superior performance and features. This pricing strategy makes them an attractive option for anyone looking for high-quality audio without overspending. As this weekend promotion unfolds, it’s essential to act quickly if you’re interested in purchasing these earbuds at this price point. Given the popularity of the AirPods Pro 2 and their appeal among Apple users, stock may deplete rapidly.

The real question is why we allow people to buy and sell carbon credits, rather than actually reduce their emissions.Because not all processes have emissions which are reducible, and because the expertise to build systems to combat climate change may not lie within the companies who produce emissions. It's a system that prices carbon while (in theory) funding alternate means of addressing it, by moving money from those people who externalise costs, to those people who attempt to minimise those external costs.In economic terms carbon credits are a really good system. If technology catches up (it won't) in a way to extract carbon from the atmosphere then it's a very real way we can force polluters to directly fund their own clean-up.Unfortunately the people doing the selling of the credits are mostly fraudsters, and the idea of selling you a tree that wasn't going to get cut down with the promise that it now still won't get cut down should result in everyone going to federal prison and sharing a cell with someone who has an impressively sized cock.

The problem is easy mode is also incredibly stupid.If you think banning commercial airline travel is \"easy\" you live in a different world than I do. I guess in your world solutions to problems are intellectual puzzles any only difficult if they are hard to solve intellectually. Let me suggest another \"easy\" solution. An 80% tax on all wealth over 1 million dollars that gets used to remove carbon from the atmosphere.  Let the people who benefited from all those emissions pay to clean them up.

Carbon neutral means the same amount of emissions as there would be if you didn't use any electricity. You are using electricity generated by a natural gas plant.

            "full_content": "Another hurricane is expected to hit Florida as the state continues recovering from Hurricane Helene. Hurricane Milton, a Category 4 storm (it weakened from a Category 5, but remains \"extremely dangerous\"), is on track to make landfall near Tampa Bay by Wednesday. It's the latest hurdle for the state's volatile real-estate market. Milton's peak wind speeds hit 160 mph on Monday. Heavy rain is expected before the storm arrives, and flooding is anticipated throughout the region. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has issued a state of emergency for 51 counties, and mandatory evacuations have begun in some areas. The mayor of Tampa, Jane Castor, has also issued a stark warning that anyone who remains in the city as Milton approaches will \"die.\" It's never a good time for a hurricane to hit, but preparing for a powerful storm while you recover from another makes the situation even more challenging. Helene caused over 220 deaths and as much as $34 billion in damage, according to an estimate from Moody's Analytics. Meanwhile, federal agencies meant to provide emergency assistance, like FEMA and the Small Business Administration, face their own cash crises. Back-to-back hurricanes represent the latest problem for a real-estate market facing buyer's remorse. The threat and cost that hurricanes pose mean Florida homeowners have some reevaluating to do if they want to remain in the state, write Business Insider's Jordan Pandy, Dan Latu, and Madeline Berg. One homeowner told BI she pays $7,000 a year in flood and hazard insurance for her 1,400-square-foot bungalow just south of Tampa. (The policies paid off, her home was deemed uninhabitable after Helene, and she still wants to live there after it's repaired.) But those high costs, coupled with the annual fear of potentially losing your home every fall, have other residents throwing in the towel. Even a few insurers have called it quits on the state, while others could increase their prices by over 300% in the coming years. It's representative of the extremes the Sunshine State's real-estate market has faced in recent years. One of the pandemic's hottest markets, some people are now souring on Florida over its climate, costs, and overcrowding. (It's not alone in its post-pandemic comedown, as Texas is facing a similar fate.) But as much as people want to get out of the state, there will always be those looking to get in. More than 8,000 miles of coastline will do that. One Florida resident whose home sustained almost three feet of water damage from Helene cut their listing price by 40%. Within hours, their real-estate agent received 25 calls from investors interested in the property. Jump to"

The first nuclear power plant was the APS-1 Obninsk, which was started in 1951 and connected to the grid in 1954. It produced 6MW, so was more of a prototype, and didn't have a containment building or really any other safety features. The AP1400 takes about a decade to build, but only at sites that already have reactors and all the other infrastructure. For example, the latest units at the Kori and Hanul plants in South Korea took a decade each. It takes longer if you are building a whole plant from scratch.  20 years is only in the west and not due to technical reasons.Question: Is that going to change?Answer: No.Question: Is it possible to take 20 years to finish a nuke, paying interest the whole time, and do so profitably?Answer: No.Question: So, will the next nuke be yet another financial debacle, just like Vogtle and Summer?Answer: Yup. 20 years is only in the west and not due to technical reasons.

The only hope of them not buggering up the climate even more is to force them to power their crap with renewable energy or by extending existing nuclear plant lifespans (if you dare). You have been misinformed about \"major strides\" in technology, it's just the same old stuff repackaged.

Regular* Data centers already consume enough that they need their own substations and grid infrastructure.  It's not as easy as just plug it in the wall.  A new data center requires months of planning with utility companies to make happen.   AI and crypto data centers often use as much energy as whole-ass powerplants produce.  It's an order of magnitude different. *you could now effectively call them \"low-power\" data centers after AI and Crypto started filling racks with GPUs instead of cpus, switches, and r  From my observation of a couple nuke projects where our local power company was part of the investment back in the 80s and 90s:  A lot of the source of overruns was the impact of delaying tactics and opposition by governments, \"public interest\" legal lobbies, and local opposition.  That's not to say that nuke plants haven't had technical and construction problems.  But it's important to recognize the cost impact created by groups seeking to block the construction.  And of course, there are no penalties to governments or lobbyists when they cause these massive delays/overruns. Yes, and the reason is that those things are bad. The same cost argument is put forth by death-penalty opponents, and for the same reason.And the solution should be the same: Take them out behind the court house and shoot them. And charge their families for the bullet.\nThey all seem to be commies anyway. They should be OK with this. The same cost argument is put forth by death-penalty opponents, and for the same reason.

The UK's currently under construction Hinkley Point C reactors are at a site that already has other reactors, so most of the environmental and legal issues were sorted long ago and any lingering ones were quickly resolved. It is still taking 20 years to build, still massively expensive and over the original budget, and will still produce the most expensive electricity in the UK. It's not particular to the UK either. The builder and operator, EDF, is having the same problems in other European countries, and gi  Every delay in licensing is a day of cost overrun, for the interest payments on the construction loans without any revenue coming in.  That seems pretty obvious to me.  And in Seabrook, the delays caused by the state of Massachusetts not submitting the required plans, etc, -as directed by the governor of Mass- (he was honest about that) stretched for several years. We have a grid for a reason.To heat my Aunt Millie's apartment.\nIn Washington State, it was common practice to site aluminum smelters just down the road from hydroelectric plants. The same logic should apply to data centers.

Have you ever seen \"Colossus: The Forbin Project\" (1970)??? That shows what happens when you hook an AGI up to a nuclear reactor: Hint: It becomes an ASI in less than 24 hours and takes over the entire world, turning some of us into pets, and killing the rest... Fantastic movie! The world uses 3,200 GW of electricity, so the projected consumption by AI is about one percent. Most AI data centers are in 1st world countries which are transitioning to renewables. They burn 'renewables' here at our local power plant, wood chips. Isn't that worse pollution wise than coal?Hard to say. If the only criterion were carbon dioxide emissions, growing wood for fuel and then burning it is net zero: the carbon dioxide emitted in burning equals the carbon dioxide captured in growing the wood. So, yes, it's a lot greener than coal in that respect.\nBurning creates other pollution, though. Wood doesn't contain any significant sulfur, so it's lower pollution that high- or medium-sulfur coal. Word burning does have other pollutants, though. And emissions will depend a lot on how it's burned-- how hot, how good the airflow is, whether the stack has scrubbers, etc.\nAs a quick estimate, including carbon dioxide as \"pollution,\" I'd say that if the combustion is up to modern standards, it's probably greener than coal, but it's not pollution free.

Why does every tech bro billionaire become such an uncaring sociopath? You have the cause and effect reversed. \nAccording to this 2019 Department of Energy article [energy.gov], a 240 Mwh lithium battery storage site costs $91 million (in 2019).  Considering that data centers run around the clock, the cost per W is $91 /(240/24) = $9/W.  Add another $1/W for the PV, and the cost is roughly $10/W. 35GW of data centers would require investing $350 million for renewable power.  They could then use this power for the next 2 decades for free.  That seems fair and probably also profitable for the data centers.\n This could apply to every new electric installation, not just data centers.\nAre you building a new 1KW house?  Pay $10K (once) for new renewable power generation.  Or put PV panels on your roof.  California already requires that all new homes have rooftop solar PV panels.  Do the same for data centers (except not on their rooftop).\n What a jerk. Without pressure to search for more efficient ways to do the same thing, often we won't try as hard.  And we won't aim resources at the problem. Otherwise this is like wishing, or praying, or whatever your favorite unproven/unreliable solution may be.  \"If this works it'll be great!\"  then lets wait for it to work before we rely on it.

I've experienced a strong *uptick* of recruiters reaching out to me, not just spam, but real opportunities. In a few cases, I had first interviews and turned them down for reasons such as not being willing to tolerate remote flexibility. But opportunities are definitely out there. Just learn to code! That's going to -- I'm sorry, what? It's the coders that're on the chopping block now? Welp, I'm out of ideas. These jobs are still needed because AI needs guidance and even with knowledge of how AI works, you need someone to fix the many iterations of what AI does to get the right information. The problem is AI needs to be supplanted with experienced developers and unfortunately that creates a skills gap because entry level gets the short end of the stick.  This to me is now different than how many of these smaller shops that used to build PCs were slowly phased out by smaller form factors that pretty much come assembled at a cost less than white box systems. At some point you will have a generation that doesn't understand the inner workings of software and just assume they didn't prompt the AI correctly whereas someone who has some level of code literacy can see where the bugs are in AI generated code and resolve them. Learning to code is still relevant, just not at the level of entry where we coded previously. Not to mention the Proof Of Concept Scope Issue- in which because an executive got one answer he liked, real or fake, he's now inclined to believe everything the AI says and discount everything his actual employees say- to the point of laying off all the humans. Just learn to code! That's going to -- I'm sorry, what? It's the coders that're on the chopping block now?Welp, I'm out of ideas.I counseled my son to not go into that field 2 decades ago. It was obvious even then. Just learn to code! That's going to -- I'm sorry, what? It's the coders that're on the chopping block now? Welp, I'm out of ideas. I counseled my son to not go into that field 2 decades ago. It was obvious even then. Two decades ago, everybody and their brother were charging head-first toward six figure salaries (those used to mean something) and the easy life of playing arcade games at a startup waiting to become millionaires. Anyone who thought this was sustainable - particularly for the general population - was failing to think. Coding ability, like most things, is an innate skill advanced by training. You can take people with little innate talent and train them to get better just like you can take Average Joe and teach him to swim faster. But Average Joe swimmer and Average Jane coder are never going to be particularly valuable in that role long term. Once the stupid money turned off, value had to be reassessed, and lots of Galaga arcades went up on eBay. Never play to the fads. Find something you're good at naturally that's valuable long term, develop your skills to become great at it, and market yourself appropriately. The world is run by mediocre people who got lucky or were born on 3rd base and think they hit a home run when they score. Its the average people who are the ones that keep the wheels turning.   And its the below average that do most of the actual work. The problem for coders is nothing new. The industry has always laid off people with aging skills and hired people straight out of college trained in the current technology. What's changing is that they are now purging more people with aging skills than they are  Older technicians can learn new technology just as easily as younger technicians.  Sometimes more easily, due to their lengthy experience learning and adapting. The reason the industry is agist against older technicians is because they are far less gullible.  They can't be manipulated into working long hours and making huge sacrifices in return for nothing extra.  They are also more expensive.  The popular notion that their skills are somehow out of date is just used as justification. There are exceptions of course.  Though any technicians who have stopped updating their skillset are probably ready to retire anyway. What's needed is people with both skills and competence to do electrical installations and coding/configuration of installations now that many homes are becoming \"smart\" in one way or another. Good network technicians are also in shortage, even if it might seem like you could as a corporation just have some central control/management you could discover that it becomes a \"keeping all eggs in the same basket\" situation.

Obviously, I was talking about (tech) jobs that can easily be done from home for the \"outdated\" comment. But for these, it really _is_ an outdated and quite wasteful model. I confess to having quite a chip on my shoulder over how hardware is never considered part of \"tech\" but web sites are. Tech jobs == jobs at tech companies.  They have a statistic for that.  Job postings are down in general. Does that mean nobody is employed or well paid?  No.  And if you were fired tomorrow, might you care about how the market is doing in general?  Yeah, I'd hope you would.  Just because you have a bubble doesn't meant he rest of the world should mirror your 'happy happy, joy joy' delusions that let you ignore the pain around you. Oh, AND they have a statistic for one prominent role at companies like those.  Does that mean only software developers work at tech companies?  No.  Is that a major employer of that title?  Probably.  Was that an industry that was seen as a great place to get into until semi-recently?  Believe so... Yeah, plus many \"software developers\" aren't really tech jobs. In fact many \"tech companies\" barely have any \"tech\" in them. \"Tech\" is a highly inflated term these days. This particular cycle, the software sector bet big on hiring for \"AI\" applications, and then found out that the applications (inaccurately) called \"AI\" are more of a toy than a product that's going to make them money.\n Wait for the next fad, they'll be hiring again.

You're absolutely right that - under the hood - there's not the sort of traditionally cognitive processing happening that we might consider intelligence. That can be a distinction without a difference if the output is the same, and for quite a lot of things, they're becoming indistinguishable. I think the real challenge for LLMs specifically is the training data. Between the limits placed technically and legally, malicious poisoning already happening, and the breakdown of function  Problem is its meaning keeps shifting as technology advances. 20 years ago image and speech recognition were considered AI. Now? Not so much. AI doesn't mean conciousness or personality, it means aspects of living beings that can be simulated by a computer. There's a bit more to it than that.  Instead of thinking about money, just think about labor as a resource for a second. Unemployment was very low, and geopolitics was already shifting slowly away from globalization, but the one-two punch of the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine caused a lot more countries to wake up to the fact that it was over, which accelerated the de-globalization trend. Of all countries, the US is probably best positioned to survive in a post-globalized world, but it still needs to adapt by rebuilding its manufacturing and industrial base (not just factories, but upgrading energy infrastructure, transportation, and update refineries to be able to process more US crude instead of Saudi crude). That requires a massive outlay of both skilled labor and capital.  Capital was abundant, but was being absorbed by silicon valley (and on ridiculous things like crypto).  But labor was tight, and it was tied up doing the wrong thing... building social media apps, and working in low value service jobs.  And that tight labor market was the result of pent up demand after the pandemic, and low borrowing costs.  People were busy going out to dinner and renovating their homes (us included) which again, absorbs skilled labor that could be used on the more important project of re-industrializing.  At the same time the government was trying to create demand for re-industrializing, which is why the get the Green New Deal and the CHIPS act.  I don't know enough about those to know if they will work to fulfill the government's goals, but they certainly force more investment into re-industrializing. Yes, layoffs were inevitable because people were working in the wrong jobs, as far as the government was concerned.  Raising interest rates was an easy way to get lots of marginally profitable companies to tighten their belts and do more with less. We even saw this at our own factory... before the pandemic most of the workers on the line were men.  After the pandemic, perhaps half of them left to take jobs in the construction industry where wages were suddenly higher, and we back-filled those positions with women moving up from service jobs (waitresses and so on).  It's always painful to re-allocate labor like that, but everyone was moving up to higher value jobs, and the fact that low-income Americans saw wage growth outpace inflation is a testament to that fact. Yip, cyclical. The tricky part is one of the cycles skipped by for some reason, and people got complacent. There have been IT slumps starting approximately in 1983 (game crash), 1992 (Glasnost), 2002 (Dotcom bubble), and this one. There should have been one around 2010, but the smartphone boom appears to have injected market energy, absorbing non-phone IT layoffs caused by the mortgage bubble crash. That is just a claim by Amazon, which benefits from the AI hype. Caveat lector. I don't know any software developers looking for jobs, particularly those with 3+ years of experience, which is virtually all of them.\n  If you're in marketing or the non technical side, then yeah, those jobs are gone. Tech companies were the first to lay off jobs that could be augmented by AI.  Especially ones generating ad copy.\n  But to reiterate, I don't know of any software developers looking for jobs, or if they are, they're not sitting around looking for jobs for very long. I know one that is looking. I doubt it will take him long to find a new one, and I sent him a few leads I know (my company is hiring for example). There are fewer remote-only contract jobs than they used to be. Lots of place one full-time with transition to a location near the company office. That sort of job doesn't really cut it for coders who have kids or grandkids. Entry-level jobs for fresh grads seem downright ethereal these days though. Like you said, a lot of them demand about several years of experience right off the bat for what is basically a glorified junior-level position. It gate keeps a lot of fresh talent from developing the necessary experience to progress in the job market. That all said, I think what people miss are the days when punching out a summer session in boot camp was an almost guaranteed path to a six-figure salary. Those days are definitely gon  I'm currently hiring for my team and have encountered some devs affected by these layoffs. Some of them have felt like poor performers, like they didn't meet the expectation for their former title. Some felt clearly talented and were likely part of an unimportant project that got binned or a stable enough one that was put on maintenance mode. I don't know any software developers looking for jobs Tens of thousands of software developer jobs have been terminated by big tech companies during the past two years.

AI generative models are not an end in and of themselves and are highly educated though not very smart.  However, this as a component of larger products has extraordinary potential.  So far, companies have been rushing to implement it into their existing products and that is typically less impressive than the hype.

At times of low employment, there is is less work to do so fewer positions need to be posted. However at times of high employment, there is less available labor to pursue so just posting an opening is useless for filling a position. It's only when employment is *increasing* that the job market will be large. When it is stable it will be small.

Now they must do 20% a year for any 'R&D' of which, the IRS claims ALL software is R&D (and they add extra documentation requirements, aka work, for any R&D). What if you're a new company?  Most new companies don't last 5 years.  Seems like this 2017 new law prevents new companies from entering any software market, hence it benefits any big incumbents. Though I'd guess breaks the old \"just buy a startup instead of doing R&D yourself\" paradigm lots of companies seemed to shift to (pick winners on their upward climb, instead of playing the lottery yourself).  Meaning it is hampering any previous US R&D investment which I'd be curious to hear statistics on. Another great job Trump and team!  Yes, it was passed with votes going along party lines.

That is not an entirely unfair observation. A self-help guru who has to be put into a drug-induced coma over severe addiction issues is not someone I would reasonably accept as having any significant answers to the secrets of life. Currently, he's basically cosplaying as a Christian theologian, so he seems to have bounced back enough to find a new group of stupid young men. And the problem at the heart of the issue he originally raised has still not been resolved, which was an issue of individual liberties being trampled on by the government.  I'd like to think had the issue of compelled speech happened in the U.S. the law would have been deemed unconstitutional.

If your job requires you to be in an office, you can resist, or not... but do realize that whatever work output you have is meaningless busywork. It ultimately doesn't matter, because the value of the corporation/company you're working for is effectively zero in the broad scheme of things. I don't think anyone said to quit your job if a company calls for RTO. Just keep your resume up-to-date and either don't comply with the RTO or do the absolute bare minimum or possibly less to see how far you can push it. Keeping your resume up to date is basically the strategy we've always used in this profession. Make sure you have your next job lined up and hop over there when the pay is better or the work is more interesting or the conditions are better (rarely the case, all companies kind of suck). Do  Resist RTO!  Quit your job!  they said.  Funny how for 2 years I've been seeing lay offs after lay offs and most slashdotters still don't grasp that RTO is just not something they can resist.\nWhen companies announce RTO mandates, they know that some people will quit out of protest, it's calculated into the cost of the mandate. Some companies are even using it as a form of layoff that saves them money since a person who quits doesn't get severance. Resist RTO!  Quit your job!  they said.

Is it the bottom 50% of workers?  The bottom 25%?  The bottom 10%?  Okay, what about the second-lowest 10%?  Is it okay to lay them off once the first 10% is gone?

By definition, a layoff is a position elimination. Then, it may become a choice between individuals, but skill level isn't at the top of the list.

            "full_content": "3 of Tesla's Chinese EV rivals have had a very good month — and they've thrown down a gauntlet for Elon Musk. Chinese EV makers Li Auto, Zeekr, and Xpeng all announced record September deliveries this week, putting pressure on Tesla as it prepares to release its own numbers on Wednesday. Zeekr reported sales of 21,333 electric vehicles in September, up 77% from the previous year, while Xpeng's sales rose 39% to hit 21,352. Li Auto, which sells electric cars that can include a range-extending fuel tank, announced it had delivered 53,709 vehicles in September. Meanwhile, another key rival, Nio, reported a new quarterly record for its deliveries with an 11.6% year-over-year leap.  Zeekr and Xpeng's numbers remain below Tesla's most recent figures, with Musk's company selling 63,000 cars in August 2024, per Reuters. But both companies have unveiled EVs that compete directly with Tesla's vehicles at a lower price point in recent months. Xpeng announced the Mona M03 in August, the cheapest version of which is nearly half the price of Tesla's Model 3, while Zeekr's new 7X SUV is priced lower than the best-selling Model Y. The red-hot results from local rivals come as Tesla prepares to report what are expected to be strong delivery numbers on Wednesday. Wall Street analysts polled by the London Stock Exchange Group expect Tesla to announce an 8% boost in global EV deliveries from the previous year in September, according to Reuters, on the back of strong performance in China. Tesla has wooed Chinese customers with various incentives and favorable financing plans recently and cut prices aggressively at the start of the year. While the US automaker will be watching Zeekr, Xpeng, and Li Auto closely, it is also playing catchup to global rival BYD, which dominates EV sales in China. It also temporarily overtook Tesla as the world's largest EV producer in the last quarter of 2023, with Counterpoint research analysts suggesting BYD could do so again this year. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment, sent outside normal working hours. Jump to"

            "full_content": "We're stuck in an agonizing limbo — and it's making everyone kind of bonkers. I've spent the past couple of years gently correcting the people in my life that, despite their frustrations with the economy, we are not in a recession. Yes, prices are higher, but workers' pay is, too — and the sticker shock has not stopped consumers from spending a ton. Blue-collar workers in particular have seen solid gains, and as much as there's chatter about a white-collar recession, the unemployment rate for college-educated workers remains low. But lately I've had a harder time painting such a rosy picture. The economy's not bad, but the overall situation is increasingly frustrating. As much as the inflation rate has fallen, 2019 prices aren't coming back. The Federal Reserve is going to start to cut interest rates soon and deliver some relief, but if you're considering buying a new house or car, you're probably still better off waiting. The same goes for switching jobs — given the state of the labor market, it's best to stay where you are, especially for the white-collar crowd. For months and months it's felt like the other shoe on the economy is about to drop. I mean, in October 2022, Bloomberg's economic model was saying there was a 100% chance of a recession over the next year. That recession didn't happen, but the vibecession did. Now, economic indicators aren't flashing red, but they're not flashing green either. We're in wait-and-see mode. \"There's a little bit of collective breath-holding,\" said Allison Shrivastava, an associate economist at Indeed. \"Are we going to stick this landing, or are things going to continue in a downward trend? We expected there to be a cooling labor market — that's kind of the goal — and it's always just, you know, how cool?\" The economic uncertainty is exhausting, and it's being compounded by the coming election. \"We have a lot of consumers who are telling us they're reserving judgment about what's happening until the election is resolved,\" said Joanne Hsu, the director of consumer surveys at the University of Michigan. \"They're saying there's just no way to tell.\" \"It's so over\" has become a bit of an annoying internet trope as of late. It signals a downward turn of events, things not going your way — the opposite of \"we're so back,\" when things are on the upswing. That being said, when it comes to the labor market … it is, in fact, so over. The jobs boom the US was seeing in 2021 and 2022 is well in the past, and there are clear signs of slowing. The economy added 142,000 jobs in August, and the unemployment rate ticked down slightly, to 4.2%. That's an improvement over July's 4.3% unemployment rate, but overall, the jobs market in the US is cooling off. Job openings in July were back at 2021 levels. The rates of hires and quits ticked up for the month, but they're back at pre-pandemic levels, though layoffs remain low. What that means is that if you have a job, you're likely to be able to hold on to it, but if you want to move around or are unemployed and looking for work, you might be in for a tough time. Much of this is to be expected — part of the reason the Fed raised interest rates was to slow down the economy, including the labor market. It's not reasonable to expect the economy to add jobs at the clip it was in the immediate wake of the pandemic. \"If you imagine a labor market like a bathtub, the bathtub is full,\" said Dana Peterson, the chief economist at the Conference Board. \"So you don't need to run the water, don't need to run the faucet hard anymore.\" Still, the end of a party is never particularly fun. Now, even just the knowledge that the labor market is on shakier ground is anxiety-inducing — average monthly job gains are dropping consistently, and there's no telling what will make that drop stop. Some of the story varies by sector — if you work in tech, it might be a trickier time to find a job than if you were looking for something in healthcare or construction. Some workers feel like they missed the boat on all the job hopping over the past couple of years, and now it seems like the opportunity to participate has passed. Despite the strong labor market, they're sending endless résumés into the ether without getting any bites, and they don't understand why. Jaime-Alexis Fowler, the founder of Empower Work, a nonprofit that provides a text hotline for workers, said she'd heard a lot of frustration from workers searching for good jobs and being unable to find them. That's led some of them to fall for scams and has fostered animosity among those who work in person but want to work from home. \"People were feeling there was just this dissonance between their direct experience and what they were hearing was happening with the economy,\" she said. \"And so it felt like there was something wrong with them. 'I'm not hearing back.'\" For a lot of people, the current environment just feels a little blech. There are so many unknowns that make it hard to figure out what's the right move. Do I buy the house now and pay a higher mortgage rate, or do I wait and risk home prices getting even higher six months from now? Do I try to leave this stupid job, or do I stick it out because at least maybe the higher-ups will feel a slight pang before laying me off? Do I hire someone new at my small business or just keep staffing as is? Is this the stock-market dip I should buy, or should I continue to hold out because The Big One is finally coming? Or maybe I should just buy and sell at random, because everything is kind of a casino anyway, right? Hsu said consumer sentiment is better than it was at its mid-2022 low, but it's still below its historical average. There are also some serious disparities in how different groups view the economy. \"People in the lower part of the income distribution don't actually feel all that much better than they did two years ago,\" Hsu said, \"whereas higher-income and wealthier people feel much, much better.\" Even if the labor market isn't as awesome for them, those at the higher end of the income distribution are enjoying the stock market's recent gains and the appreciation of their home values. Those on the lower end, on the other hand, aren't really benefiting from what's happening in the markets, and higher housing prices are making them poorer, because they're renters. Some economic trends that are positive in the long term aren't delivering instant effects. Michael Madowitz, the principal economist at the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank, pointed out that worker productivity — an economic measure looking at how much output workers create in the hours they're on the job — is something that gets economic nerds excited, but not so much the workers doing the producing. \"Productivity growth is a marathon,\" he said. \"Vibes are a sprint.\" The uncertainty around the outcome of the 2024 election really does hang over everything. Hsu said consumers were incorporating who they expect to win the election into their views of the economy. If X candidate comes out ahead in November, some will say that things will be great, and others will say that things will be terrible; if Y comes out ahead, they'll flip. The race is very tight, adding to the uncertainty and unease around the economy. Even though the election won't immediately change the country's economic course, it will change how people feel about it. \"With interest rates falling and getting past the election, people probably will feel better,\" Peterson said. (As long as we don't have a 2020-esque situation where we don't know the outcome for days and one of the candidates refuses to accept the results.) Not to sound like a broken record here, but the economy is decent. The labor market is OK, if slipping a little. Consumer spending is strong, and incomes are higher than they were before the pandemic. GDP growth is probably slowing, but it doesn't seem like it will fall into recession territory anytime soon. There are reasons for concern — pandemic savings have dried up, and credit-card delinquencies are rising — but there's no need to declare disaster yet. Things are just kind of slowing down and stalling out, and after a few years of strong momentum, that's making people nervous. Even a slight deterioration is uncomfortable for everybody, and for some people, it can feel dire. We're stuck in limbo, and that limbo is just not a fun place to be.

            "full_content": "Israel launched a ground offensive against Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon on Tuesday in a marked escalation of tensions in the Middle East — and the energy markets largely shrugged. The indifference is significant because the Middle East is a huge producer of crude oil — pumping one-third of the world's supply — so any geopolitical tension in the region could spark some sort of meaningful price gain. This time, oil prices simply nudged up a little. Global benchmark Brent crude oil futures were up 0.17% to $71.82 per barrel at 2.14 a.m. ET. Benchmark US West Texas Intermediate futures were 0.19% higher, at $68.32 per barrel. Notably, the gains followed a 17% decline in Brent and a 16% drop in US WTI futures over the third quarter of the year, when traders were on edge for upside price action amid the developments in the Middle East. The reason isn't rocket science. It's mostly China — the world's largest importer of crude oil. \"The main cause for the bearish sentiment has been a steady slowing of crude demand growth, especially in China,\" wrote Henning Gloystein, the practice head of energy, climate, and resources at the Eurasia Group, last month. The world's second-largest economy has been struggling to stage a convincing recovery post-pandemic and is battling multiple challenges, including a property crisis, high youth unemployment, and deflation. Beijing pulled out an economic stimulus package last week that massively boosted sentiment in China's previously downbeat stock markets, but most analysts are saying the measures are just not enough to turn the situation around on the ground. Even Chinese leader Xi Jinping acknowledged the extent of China's problems in the country's National Day speech on Monday, saying the path forward wouldn't be smooth. BMI, a research firm, wrote last week that short positions in Brent outnumbered longs for the first time earlier in September. \"Sentiment in the market is already weak, with a bearish macro narrative weighing heavily to the downside, and investors are currently far more responsive to bearish price drivers than to bullish ones,\" wrote BMI's analysts. The sentiment over China has been so poor that Saudi Arabia has pretty much thrown in the towel on pushing oil higher. The kingdom — which is the world's largest crude exporter and OPEC's de facto leader — is giving up its $100 per barrel price target and ready to increase oil output, the Financial Times reported last week. This means that Saudi Arabia is looking to corner a larger market share instead of targeting higher profit margins by restricting output. This would be a big shift in policy, since Saudi Arabia has been leading OPEC and the group's allies, including Russia, in maintaining oil supply cuts since late 2022. Despite the downside pressure on oil prices, things could change quickly if geopolitical uncertainty rises further in the Middle East. The US may also provide some support to the market as crude oil inventories hit a two-and-a-half year low as of September 20, the latest data available. \"Yes, it is true that traders are worried about the fact that Chinese demand for oil is not back yet to a level that can make the OPEC stop extending the supply cut process,\" wrote Naeem Aslam, the CIO at London-based Zaye Capital Markets. \"However, the fact that the US oil stockpiles are clearing more quickly indicates that the demand for oil in the world's largest economy is trending in the right direction, which is positive for price action,\" Aslam added.

Now, in 2024, the company has launched the Oura Ring 4, which features plenty of upgrades over its predecessor and an improved design. However, if you're thinking you should just get the latest model, you might wanna consider this Prime Day deal on the best Oura Ring Gen 3 style instead. The Oura Ring Gen 3 comes in two styles, with the Heritage starting at $299 and Horizon starting at $349. However, this Prime Day deal brings the newer Horizon model down to $299 for the silver and black colorways, and depending on the size, you can even find the ring for as low as $280.  Oura Ring Gen 3 (Horizon): $349 $299 at Amazon The Oura Ring Gen 3 is the ring that pretty much started it all. It's a discreet health tracker that measures your heart rate, monitors your temperature, tracks your sleep, and much more. The pricier Horizon style normally costs a premium over the Heritage, but with $50 off, you can get it for the same price. After using the Oura Ring Gen 3 for a few years, I can honestly say that it's one of the best wearables I've owned. It comes with plenty of features and has a seven-day battery life despite its small size. And yet, Oura keeps stuffing more and more features into this small ring, making it well worth the cost of ownership. Sure, the Oura Ring 4 comes with better battery life, higher accuracy, and better activity tracking, but the Oura Ring Gen 3 is still one of the best smart rings on the market and, in some ways, is better than many Android smartwatches. And the Horizon style is the better-looking option over the Heritage style, especially since it looks nearly identical to the Oura Ring 4. I like my Heritage model, but if I could afford the Horizon style, that would've been my choice. Fortunately, Prime Day is making that a little bit easier for shoppers. ✅Recommended if: You want a discreet health tracking wearable that you can use to monitor your daily activity, sleep, stress, and more. ❌Skip this deal if: You want the latest Oura Ring 4 or you prefer a smart ring without a monthly subscription. There hasn't been a better time to buy a smart ring, but you'll want to get in on this deal now, because once the Oura Ring Gen 3 is out of stock, that'll be it! And some of you may be happy to know that the ring is FSA/HSA eligible, which could make purchasing one even easier. Otherwise, you can check out these Prime Day deals on smartwatches if you want something a bit more involved and interactive.

Priced at just $349.95 down from its original $459.99, this offer is a (very) rare opportunity to own one of the best stand mixers on the market at a fraction of its usual cost. See at Amazon Unlike many Prime Day offers, this discount is available to everyone, including non-Prime members, this Monday. It’s an unprecedented move from Amazon that allows all cooking enthusiasts to take advantage of this significant price drop on a premium kitchen appliance. The KitchenAid Artisan Stand Mixer is renowned for its versatility and performance. Its 5-quart stainless steel bowl with a comfortable handle provides ample capacity for large batches and it is capable of mixing dough for 9 dozen cookies or 4 loaves of bread in a single go. The mixer’s power and efficiency are further enhanced by its 59-Point Planetary Mixing Action that ensures thorough ingredient incorporation with 59 touch points per rotation around the bowl. One of the much appreciated features of this mixer is its power hub which transforms it into a true culinary center. With over 15 optional attachments available (from pasta makers to food grinders), the possibilities for culinary creativity are endless. This adaptability makes the KitchenAid Artisan not just a mixer but a fantastic kitchen tool that can tackle a wide array of cooking and baking tasks. The tilt-head design is another user-friendly feature of this KitchenAid mixer and provides easy access to the bowl and attachments for adding ingredients or changing accessories. This model comes complete with a coated flat beater, coated dough hook, 6-wire whip and a 1-piece pouring shield, all of which are dishwasher-safe for easy cleaning.

This longevity is an excellent investment for any kitchen. It’s worth noting that KitchenAid rarely offers such significant discounts on their products that’s why this Prime Day deal is particularly noteworthy. The brand’s reputation for quality and the mixer’s versatility are expected to make this one of the top-selling items in its category during the Prime Day event.

            "full_content": "By  Gaby Del Valle, a policy reporter. Her past work has focused on immigration politics, border surveillance technologies, and the rise of the New Right. The FBI created a cryptocurrency as part of an investigation into price manipulation in crypto markets, the government revealed on Wednesday. The FBI’s Ethereum-based token, NexFundAI, was created with the help of “cooperating witnesses.” As a result of the investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged three “market makers” and nine people for allegedly engaging in schemes to boost the prices of certain crypto assets. The Department of Justice charged 18 people and entities for “widespread fraud and manipulation” in crypto markets. The defendants allegedly made false claims about their tokens and executed so-called “wash trades” to create the impression of an active trading market, prosecutors claim. The three market makers — ZMQuant, CLS Global, and MyTrade — allegedly wash traded or conspired to wash trade on behalf of NexFundAI, an Ethereum-based token they didn’t realize was created by the FBI.  “What the FBI uncovered in this case is essentially a new twist to old-school financial crime,” Jodi Cohen, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Boston division, said in a statement. “What we uncovered has resulted in charges against the leadership of four cryptocurrency companies, and four crypto ‘market makers’ and their employees who are accused of spearheading a sophisticated trading scheme that allegedly bilked honest investors out of millions of dollars.” Liu Zhou, a “market maker” working with MyTrade MM, allegedly told promoters of NexFundAI that MyTrade MM was better than its competitors because they “control the pump and dump” allowing them to “do inside trading easily.” An FBI spokesperson told CoinDesk that there was limited trading activity on the coin but didn’t share additional information. On a Wednesday press call, Joshua Levy, the acting US attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said trading on the token was disabled, according to CoinDesk. The DOJ has reportedly secured $25 million from “fraudulent proceeds” that will be returned to investors.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.
